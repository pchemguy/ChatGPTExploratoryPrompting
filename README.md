# ChatGPT Tutorial

Here, I am sharing some of my experience regarding the efficient use of ChatGPT in the hope that it might be helpful to beginners like myself. Presently, I have the following major learning objectives for ChatGPT as tool:

## 1. Writing assistance for efficient technical and business writing

Both my job and hobbies involve technical and business writing. Among other things, technical writing may act as an efficient learning / research tool (as in "learning through writing"). For example, as I started writing this text, I had realized that I probably had four learning objectives, not three. As opposed to fiction, a typical goal of a non-fiction reader is to minimize the time spent reading and maximize the amount and completeness of relevant information retrieved. To this end, I am interested in mastering ChatGPT as an aid for improving my writing efficiency, which is largely about maximizing accessibility of conveyed information.

As far as improvement of non-fiction texts efficiency is concerned, ChatGPT performs reasonably well even with basic prompts (such as "Convert the following text into standard English"). However, having comprehensive instructions handy helps often improves the result of a prompt. Moreover, both text and code editing should always be considered as iterative processes. With detailed well-layed-out instructions at hand, it is relatively convenient to refine individual aspects of the text. For this purpose, I have developed two documents:

* Stylistic Guidelines ([Writing Style Guidelines for Technical and Business Texts][WritingStyleGuidelines])  
  These guidelines are designed to be sent directly to ChatGPT and focus on writing mechanics, structure, vocabulary, sentence construction, and coherence. These aspects should apply to most common non-fiction writing activities.
* Context Template ([Writing Context Guidelines][WritingContext])  
  This template offers customizable options for defining higher-level writing aspects, such as audience, domain, intent, formality, tone, and other contextual factors. It also allows for tailored "profile" contexts (e.g., "LinkedIn Post") that can be included when submitting the entire contents to ChatGPT, instructing it to apply a specific profile.
