# ChatGPT Exploratory Prompting

This repository shares my beginner-level exploration of ChatGPT's features and related workflows. My current interests encompass four broad topics: two focused on applications (_coding support and guidance_ and _technical and business writing assistance_) and two centered on technical aspects closely tied to ChatGPT’s routine use (_memory management_ and _meta-prompting_). I utilize several content formats to share my experience:

- Descriptive writing,
- ChatGPT instruction templates,
- Collections of selected prompts/questions and ChatGPT answers focused on specific topics (Q&A),
- ChatGPT conversations showcasing possible workflows applied to model problems.

All ChatGPT responses are based on the GPT-4o model and are provided "as is", without critical evaluation unless explicitly stated otherwise. In the context of Q&A collections, I approach ChatGPT as a powerful tool for topic exploration. My objective is not to offer definitive solutions but to highlight overlooked considerations, transforming some of the 'unknown unknowns' in ChatGPT workflows into 'known unknowns'.

This repository is a work in progress. While some development may occur in the `dev` branch, I aim to update the `main` branch regularly. As a result, content may change periodically, and portions may appear incomplete or inconsistent at any given time.

## Model problems

So far, I have used two related model problems to explore features of ChatGPT as a coding assistant.

## Memory management

The baseline power of ChatGPT comes, of course, from the model training. On top of that, a crucial role in answer generation is played by the [memory context](https://help.openai.com/en/collections/8471548-memory). I do not have a clear understanding of what memory context actually includes, but it might be convenient to think of it as a set of bullet points collected / generated by ChatGPT while answering provided prompts. At the very beginning, ChatGPT uses just the model training to produce the answers, but later on memory context helps ChatGPT generate more tailored answers. Moreover, memory context facilitates handling complex topics, iterative refinement, and enables special prompting techniques.

Memory context consists of several components:
- **Temporary context** is derived from the contents of the current conversation and applies only to that specific interaction.  
  Using the prompt `Show me temporary context and explain how I can modify it` should display its current state along with instructions for modification.
- **Persistent memory** is derived from the contents of all conversations and applies universally across interactions.  
  As of this writing (December 2024), persistent memory must be enabled in `Settings -> Personalization -> Memory`. Its current status can be checked using the prompt `Is persistent memory on?`. If persistent memory is enabled, the prompt `Show me persistent memory and explain how I can modify it` will display its contents along with instructions for modification. The same `Memory` menu includes a "Manage" button, which allows you to remove items from persistent memory. Additionally, the tab provides access to a sub-popup for [custom instructions](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8096356-custom-instructions-for-chatgpt), which are also part of the persistent memory.

Note: The context displayed using the appropriate prompts or in the memory manager likely provides only a brief summary. The output may also vary if requests are repeated. Additionally, depending on the current context, ChatGPT may decline to answer these questions directly. For this reason, it is recommended to query ChatGPT about persistent memory from a new, blank chat (without any temporary context).

Basic memory-related prompts include
- `Is persistent memory on?`  
- `Show me persistent memory and explain how I can modify it`  
- `Show me temporary context and explain how I can modify it`  
A [separate page](https://github.com/pchemguy/ChatGPTExploratoryPrompting/blob/main/Technical/MemoryManagementQnA.md) includes an extended collection of prompts and answers related to memory management.

## Meta-prompting

Since the relevance of ChatGPT responses substantially depend on the quality of prompts, and because ChatGPT seems to be good at  transformative and creative writing tasks, it appears to be a natural question to see if ChatGPT can improve its own prompts.

## Writing assistance for efficient technical and business writing

Both my work and hobbies involve technical and business writing. The primary goal of non-fiction readers is typically to minimize the time spent reading while maximizing the amount and completeness of relevant information retrieved. Consequently, the efficiency of non-fiction texts heavily depends on their accessibility and clarity.  

ChatGPT performs reasonably well in enhancing the efficiency of non-fiction texts, even with basic prompts like "Convert the following text into standard English". However, using detailed and comprehensive instructions often leads to significantly improved results. Additionally, editing — whether for text or code — should always be viewed as an iterative process, akin to traditional writing, where drafts undergo multiple revisions and refinements. Well-structured instructions effectively drive ChatGPT, simplifying the overall revision process and targeted refinement of specific text aspects.

To streamline this refinement process, I have developed two documents:

- **Stylistic Guidelines** ([Writing Style Guidelines for Technical and Business Texts][WritingStyleGuidelines]):  
    These guidelines are designed to be provided directly to ChatGPT and focus on core aspects such as writing mechanics, structure, vocabulary, sentence construction, and overall coherence. They are applicable to most common non-fiction writing tasks.
    
- **Context Template** ([Writing Context Guidelines][WritingContext]):  
    This template offers customizable options for defining high-level writing parameters, including audience, domain, intent, formality, tone, and other contextual factors. It also allows for creating tailored "profile" contexts (e.g., "LinkedIn Post"), which can be included when submitting instructions to ChatGPT, enabling it to adapt to specific needs.    

While the above documents do not include examples, examples can be generated easily using appropriate prompts. For instance, a section from the [Writing Style Guidelines][WritingStyleGuidelines] can be copied and prefixed with a general instruction, for example:

<details>
<summary><b>ChatGPT Sample Prompt</b></summary>

```
I have a section from the writing style guidelines and need
three defective examples for each bullet point, along with
their corresponding corrected versions.

Structure lists and series with clear, parallel elements:
- Parallel Structure:  
    Ensure parallelism in:  
    - Lists and series  
    - Coordinating conjunctions (e.g., and, but, or)  
    - Correlative conjunctions (e.g., either...or, neither...nor)  
    - Comparisons (e.g., more than, as...as)  
    - Infinitive phrases (e.g., to increase, to improve)  
    - Gerund phrases (e.g., filing, answering)  
    - Verb tense within series  
    - Clauses within sentences
```
</details>

While ChatGPT is developed as a conversational tool that should be easily accessible to beginners, learning certain technical aspects may drastically improve the results, as evidenced by the emergence of the prompt engineering field.

Iterative focused refinement
Technical aspects for tailoring answers
