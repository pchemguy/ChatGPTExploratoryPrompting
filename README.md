# ChatGPT Exploratory Prompting

In this repository, I share my beginner's experience exploring features of ChatGPT and related workflows. Unless otherwise specified, all ChatGPT responses assume the use of the GPT-4o model. The key areas of interest include:

- Technical aspects of prompting, such as memory context management and meta-prompting
- Coding support and guidance
- Non-fiction writing assistance, with a focus on technical and business contexts

**Disclaimer:**  
This repository is a work in progress. While some development may occur on the `dev` branch, I aim to update the `main` branch more frequently or directly. As a result, content may change periodically, and portions may appear incomplete or inconsistent at any given time.

## 1. Memory management and meta-prompting

While ChatGPT is developed as a conversational tool that should be easily accessible to beginners, for now, learning certain technical aspects may significantly improve the results. In particular, basic understanding of *memory management* and *prompting/meta-prompting techniques* may facilitate routine interactions with ChatGPT. At the same time, ChatGPT can be a powerful tool for topic exploration, and, to gain technical insights about ChatGPT, I actively used it along with other more conventional approaches and wanted to share a selection of related questions/prompts and answers. As a beginner, I probably cannot fully appreciate the limitations of ChatGPT even in specific use cases, neither could I critically evaluate the included answers. Acknowledging these limitations, the purpose is not to provide definitive solutions but to highlight overlooked considerations, transforming some of the 'unknown unknowns' of ChatGPT workflows into 'known unknowns'. My hope is that these collections may provide useful insights to others on a similar path.

Two such topics include GPT memory management and meta-prompting.

### Memory management

The baseline power of ChatGPT comes, of course, from the model training. On top of that, a crucial role in answer generation is played by the [memory context](https://help.openai.com/en/collections/8471548-memory). I do not have a clear understanding of what memory context actually includes, but it might be convenient to think of it as a set of bullet points collected / generated by ChatGPT while answering provided prompts. At the very beginning, ChatGPT uses just the model training to produce the answers, but later on memory context helps ChatGPT generate more tailored answers. Moreover, memory context facilitates handling complex topics, iterative refinement, and enables special prompting techniques.

Memory context consists of several components:
- **Temporary context** is derived from the contents of the current conversation / chat and only applies to that conversation / chat.
  The `Show me temporary context and explain how I can modify it` prompt should yield its current state and modification instructions.
- **Persistent memory** is derived from the contents of all conversations / chats and applies to all of them.
  As of this writing (12/24), persistent memory needs to be enabled in `Settings -> Personalization -> Memory`.  The same tab also provides the "Manage" button which makes it possible to remove items from persistent context. The final piece on the same tab is a link to sub-popup focused on [custom instructions](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8096356-custom-instructions-for-chatgpt), which is also a part of persistent context.
  The `Is persistent memory on?` prompt should tell you whether persistent memory is enabled, but its status can only be changed manually. If persistent memory is enabled. the `Show me persistent memory and explain how I can modify it` prompt should produce the contents of the persistent memory and modification instructions.

Note: the contents of the context displayed with appropriate prompts (above) or in the memory manager probably only shows a brief summary, and the output may not be necessarily identical, if requests are repeated. Also, depending on the current context, ChatGPT may refuse to answer the questions directly. For this reason, it is better to interrogate ChatGPT regarding the persistent memory



## 2. Coding assistance

**TODO**

## 3. Writing assistance for efficient technical and business writing

Both my work and hobbies involve technical and business writing. The primary goal of non-fiction readers is typically to minimize the time spent reading while maximizing the amount and completeness of relevant information retrieved. Consequently, the efficiency of non-fiction texts heavily depends on their accessibility and clarity.  

ChatGPT performs reasonably well in enhancing the efficiency of non-fiction texts, even with basic prompts like "Convert the following text into standard English". However, using detailed and comprehensive instructions often leads to significantly improved results. Additionally, editing — whether for text or code — should always be viewed as an iterative process, akin to traditional writing, where drafts undergo multiple revisions and refinements. Well-structured instructions effectively drive ChatGPT, simplifying the overall revision process and targeted refinement of specific text aspects.

To streamline this refinement process, I have developed two documents:

- **Stylistic Guidelines** ([Writing Style Guidelines for Technical and Business Texts][WritingStyleGuidelines]):  
    These guidelines are designed to be provided directly to ChatGPT and focus on core aspects such as writing mechanics, structure, vocabulary, sentence construction, and overall coherence. They are applicable to most common non-fiction writing tasks.
    
- **Context Template** ([Writing Context Guidelines][WritingContext]):  
    This template offers customizable options for defining high-level writing parameters, including audience, domain, intent, formality, tone, and other contextual factors. It also allows for creating tailored "profile" contexts (e.g., "LinkedIn Post"), which can be included when submitting instructions to ChatGPT, enabling it to adapt to specific needs.    

While the above documents do not include examples, examples can be generated easily using appropriate prompts. For instance, a section from the [Writing Style Guidelines][WritingStyleGuidelines] can be copied and prefixed with a general instruction, for example:

<details>
<summary><b>ChatGPT Sample Prompt</b></summary>

```
I have a section from the writing style guidelines and need
three defective examples for each bullet point, along with
their corresponding corrected versions.

Structure lists and series with clear, parallel elements:
- Parallel Structure:  
    Ensure parallelism in:  
    - Lists and series  
    - Coordinating conjunctions (e.g., and, but, or)  
    - Correlative conjunctions (e.g., either...or, neither...nor)  
    - Comparisons (e.g., more than, as...as)  
    - Infinitive phrases (e.g., to increase, to improve)  
    - Gerund phrases (e.g., filing, answering)  
    - Verb tense within series  
    - Clauses within sentences
```
</details>
