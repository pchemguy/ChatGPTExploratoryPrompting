# Repo Conventions

## GPT Model

The GPT-4o model is used as the base model for the purpose of this repository (pchemguy/ChatGPTPromptEngineering).

## Sample Prompts and Answers

By default, I will not provide answers to presented sample prompts. At the same time, some sections are mostly prompts or Q&A.

Note, to get answers not influenced by conversational context, it might be a good idea to ask them in new chats or chats with little history. I format questions/prompts using heading styles, so that they appear in the TOC/outline created by GitHub, Obsidian, and, probably other tools.



# ChatGPT Tutorial

In this repository, I share my beginner experience exploring features of ChatGPT and the associated workflows. To a certain extent, this project is about "learning through writing", and presently, I have the following major ChatGPT learning objectives:

## 1. Writing assistance for efficient technical and business writing

Both my job and hobbies involve technical and business writing. As opposed to fiction, a typical goal of a non-fiction reader is to minimize the time spent reading and maximize the amount and completeness of relevant information retrieved. Therefore, the efficiency of non-fiction texts largely depends on their information accessibility.  

When it comes to improving the efficiency of non-fiction texts, ChatGPT performs reasonably well even with basic prompts (such as "Convert the following text into standard English"). However, having comprehensive instructions handy often helps improve the result of a prompt. Moreover, both text and code editing should always be considered iterative processes, similar to conventional writing, where one goes through a series of drafts, revisions, and edits. With detailed well-layed-out instructions at hand, it is relatively convenient to refine individual aspects of the text. For this purpose, I have developed two documents:

- Stylistic Guidelines ([Writing Style Guidelines for Technical and Business Texts][WritingStyleGuidelines])  
    These guidelines are designed to be sent directly to ChatGPT and focus on writing mechanics, structure, vocabulary, sentence construction, and coherence. These aspects should apply to most common non-fiction writing activities.
    
- Context Template ([Writing Context Guidelines][WritingContext])  
    This template offers customizable options for defining higher-level writing aspects, such as audience, domain, intent, formality, tone, and other contextual factors. It also allows for tailored "profile" contexts (e.g., "LinkedIn Post") that can be included when submitting the entire contents to ChatGPT, instructing it to apply a specific profile.

## 2. Coding assistance

**TODO**

## 3. Technical aspects and workflows

While ChatGPT is probably developed as a conversational tool that should be easily accessible to beginners, learning certain technical aspects definitely improves the results, as evidenced by the emergence of prompt engineering.
