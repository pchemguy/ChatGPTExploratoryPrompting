# Application of General Purpose LLM Models to Deep Analysis of Academic Publications - Research Directions

- General purpose vs. specialized models
- non-reasoning vs. reasoning vs. deep research for complex tasks (such as deep analysis of academic publications)
- fine-tuning vs. in-context learning
- context size limit, tokens, output token limit
- free vs. subscriptions based plans:
    - models not available on free plan or available with significantly reduced input/output token limits
    - privacy considerations (user data being used for model training on free plan vs. promise not use it on subscription-based plans)
- importance of large input context for many-shot learning
