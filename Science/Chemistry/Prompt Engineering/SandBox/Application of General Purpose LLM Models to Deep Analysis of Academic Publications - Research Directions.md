# Prompt Engineering for Deep Analysis of Academic Publications - Research Directions

Audience: Graduate students, postdocs, researches, scientists in natural and life sciences with no technical knowledge about LLM / prompt engineering and limited to no familiarity with different types of models (non-reasoning vs. reasoning vs. deep research), their abilities to perform complex research-related tasks, their strength and weakness, and their suitability (when to use what type of model).

Goal: Discussion of potential abilities of top general purpose LLM models to perform deep academic publication analysis. Discussion of limitations of the brute-force approach (a-la "review manuscript"), potential strategies for addressing limitations using current state-of-the-art models in combination with advanced prompting techniques / prompt engineering, following by presentation of prompt engineering questions identifying potential prompt engineering research directions towards developing toolset for deep analysis of academic publications.

Note: Potential prompt engineering research directions are presented in the form of a structured Deep Research Prompt to be also developed and that should be suitable to leading Deep Research models without tailoring to any specific vendor.

## Results of initial brainstorming for the introduction

- General purpose vs. specialized models
- Limited abilities of genereal-purpose models to perform highly-specialized tasks, such as deep paper manuscript analysis due to lack of training material
- Chain-of-Thought and Hierarchical decomposition approaches to handling complex tasks with limited to no relevant training data available for training foundation models.
- non-reasoning vs. reasoning vs. deep research for complex tasks (such as deep analysis of academic publications)
- fine-tuning vs. in-context learning
- context size limit, tokens, output token limit
- free vs. subscriptions based plans:
    - models not available on free plan or available with significantly reduced input/output token limits
    - privacy considerations (user data being used for model training on free plan vs. promise not use it on subscription-based plans)
- importance of large input context for many-shot learning


- field scope: experimental chemistry due to author's background expertise
- format - deep research prompt
- disclaimer - aggressive use of LLM Chatbots for text development
