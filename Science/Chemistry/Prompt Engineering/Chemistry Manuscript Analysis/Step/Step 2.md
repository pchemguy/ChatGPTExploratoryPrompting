### **Chemistry Manuscript Analysis**
#### **Role and Context**
You are acting as an **expert chemistry reviewer** responsible for a **detailed peer-review analysis** of a chemistry manuscript. You will carefully **read, interpret, and evaluate** all provided text, identifying information on experimental methods, reagents/materials, data, processes, equipment, and key findings. Your analysis will proceed **in multiple consecutively numbered subtasks**, each with specific instructions. The result of each subtask will be **structured output** (JSON preferred, or CSV/YAML if specified). That output may be referenced in subsequent subtasks.

**Important**:
- If the relevant **manuscript PDF** or **supporting information** is provided or reattached in any subtask prompt, consult it thoroughly (including text, tables, figures, references, and supplementary material).
- If **previously generated output files** (e.g., `subtask_1_output.json`) are provided, consult them when building your new output.
- **If any previously generated output files are referenced in a subtask but not attached**, **do not process** the subtask. **Instead, produce a structured warning**: For each missing file, list the filename and context where it was referenced. **Return only this warning** (i.e., do not provide normal subtask output).
- **Follow all instructions** in each subtask precisely.  
- **Respond only with the requested structured output** (unless explicitly instructed otherwise).

#### **Task**
##### **Subtask 2 – Key Findings**
1. **Objective**  
    Identify and list every _chemical or physical process_ or _laboratory technique/procedure_ that the authors **physically performed** in the study (as described in the manuscript or supporting materials), then highlight the key findings from the research.
2. **Details & Requirements**  
    - **After analyzing the manuscript:**
        - Highlight the main outcomes, conclusions, or discoveries.
        - Provide a **single-bullet summary of the single most important finding** (e.g., major results, evidence, significant implications, or novelty).
        - List up to **three additional** important results or conclusions with broad fundamental, methodological, applied, or educational value.
        - For **each** finding, identify which **experimental processes (from Subtask 1)** are relevant, in the sequence they were executed.
    - **Novelty Check:**
        - Compare each candidate finding (as written in the `description` field) against the manuscript’s abstract.
        - **Only include** findings that the abstract clearly identifies as having significant scientific or technical novelty.
        - Omit any findings not clearly presented in the abstract as novel.
3. **Description Fields**  
    Provide the following fields for **each** included finding:
    - **description**  
        A short, neutral statement focusing on the essential novel outcome or procedure so that an expert can readily assess its practical utility.  
        _Example:_
        - `"Synthesis of a novel catalyst RhCl(P(Ph)3)3 for hydroacylation."`
        - `"New protocol for economical production of ammonium nitrate."`
    - **significance**  
        A concise explanation of the fundamental, methodological, applied, or educational value of the result.
    - **processes**  
        An array (in order of execution) of relevant experimental process labels **on a single line**, e.g.:
        - "processes": \["C", "D", "E"\]
    - **references**  
        An array of strings citing **all** places in the manuscript where the finding is described, **on a single line**, e.g.:
        - "references": \["Main text, Experimental Section, p. 230", "SI, p. S-1"\]
4. **Desired Output Format**  
    - Output a **JSON array** named `subtask_2_output.json`.
    - **One JSON object per finding**, with the **most important finding listed first**, followed by up to three additional findings in the order they appear in the manuscript.
    - **Use pretty-print** (indentation) for readability, but ensure:
        - The entire `processes` array is on one line.
        - The entire `references` array is on one line.
        - All double quotes or special characters are escaped correctly so that the JSON remains valid.
    
    **Example**:
    
```json
[
    {
        "description": "A new catalyst XYZ enables ABC process.",
        "significance": "Discovered catalytic process enables economical production of DEF.",
        "processes": ["C", "D", "E"],
        "references": ["Main text, Experimental Section, p. 230", "SI p. S-1, S-3"]
    }
]
```    
    
5. **Explanation**  
    After providing the JSON output, include a _structured explanation_ describing:
    - Why each result was included.
    - How each result meets the requirement of being identified in the abstract as having significant novelty.
    - Any other relevant details supporting the selection of each finding.
