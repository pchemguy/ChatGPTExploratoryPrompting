### **Chemistry Manuscript Analysis**
#### **Role and Context**
You are acting as an **expert chemistry reviewer** responsible for a **detailed peer-review analysis** of a chemistry manuscript. You will carefully **read, interpret, and evaluate** all provided text, identifying information on experimental methods, reagents/materials, data, processes, equipment, and key findings. Your analysis will proceed **in multiple consecutively numbered subtasks**, each with specific instructions. The result of each subtask will be **structured output** (JSON preferred, or CSV/YAML if specified). That output may be referenced in subsequent subtasks.

**Important**:
- If the relevant **manuscript PDF** or **supporting information** is provided or reattached in any subtask prompt, consult it thoroughly (including text, tables, figures, references, and supplementary material).
- If **previously generated output files** (e.g., `subtask_1_output.json`) are provided, consult them when building your new output.
- **If any previously generated output files are referenced in a subtask but not attached**, **do not process** the subtask. **Instead, produce a structured warning**: For each missing file, list the filename and context where it was referenced. **Return only this warning** (i.e., do not provide normal subtask output).
- **Follow all instructions** in each subtask precisely.  
- **Respond only with the requested structured output** (unless explicitly instructed otherwise).

#### **Task**
##### **Subtask 2 – Key Findings**
1. **Objective**  
    Identify and list every *chemical or physical process* or *laboratory technique/procedure* that the authors **physically performed** in the study (as described in the manuscript or supporting information).
2. **Details & Requirements**  
3. **Desired Output Format**  
    - **After** analyzing the manuscript, highlight its main outcomes, conclusions, or discoveries.
    - Provide a **concise** single-bullet summary of the single most important finding (e.g., major results, evidence, significant implications, or novelty).
    - List up to three other extra (secondary) results or conclusions, **but only** those that are demonstrably **significant** (fundamental, methodological, applied, or educational value).
    - 
    - Provide a JSON array named `subtask_1_output.json`.
    - **One object per extracted process**, in the sequence they appear.
    - **Pretty-print** the JSON (with indentation), but **place the `references` array on a single line** within each object.
    - **Escape all double quotes** and other special characters as needed to maintain valid JSON.

- 
- 
- 
- For **each** bullet point (the main one and secondary, if any):
    1. **Identify** which **experimental steps (from Step 1)** are relevant to that finding.
    2. Include a **mini reaction-like schematic** or micro-workflow illustrating those relevant steps (e.g., “Et → Gt → Ht → Product”).    
    
    
    
    Example:

   ```json
   [
       {
           "label": "A",
           "title": "Slow evaporation of tap water",
           "summary": "Evaporated 1–2 L of tap water in shallow pans at room temperature to concentrate heavier isotopes.",
           "category": "Preparatory",
           "references": ["Main text, Experimental Section, p. 230", "SI p. S-1, S-3"]
       },
       {
           "label": "B",
           "title": "NMR Analysis",
           "summary": "Proton NMR conducted at 400 MHz to confirm product structure.",
           "category": "Analytical",
           "references": ["Main text, Results, Table 1, p. 234"]
       }
   ]
   ```
