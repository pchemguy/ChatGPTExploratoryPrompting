	"title": "Enrichment of H2_17O from Tap Water, Characterization of the Enriched Water, and Properties of Several 17O-Labeled Compounds",
	"abstract": "A low-abundance form of water, H2_17O, was enriched from 0.04% to ~90% by slow evaporation and fractional distillation of tap water. The density and refractive index for H2_17O are reported. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) of 16O- and 17O-1-hexanols and their trimethyl silyl ethers and of 16O and 17O-hexamethyl disiloxanes was used to determine the percentage of 17O enrichment in the H2_17O. Furthermore, the chemical shifts of labeled and nonlabeled water dissolved in CDCl3 differed sufficiently that we could verify the enrichment of H2_17O. 17O hexanol was synthesized by the reaction of iodohexane with Na17OH. 17O-Labeled trimethylsilanol and 17O-labeled hexamethyldisiloxane were prepared by the reaction of H2_17O with bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA). To generate standards for 17O NMR, H2_17O2, and 17O camphor were prepared. H2_17O was electrolyzed to form 17O-labeled hydrogen peroxide which was quantified using two colorimetric assays. 17O-Labeled camphor was prepared by exchanging the ketone oxygen of camphor using H2_17O. The 17O-labeled compounds were characterized using 17O, 1H, and 13C NMR and GC-MS. While we were characterizing the labeled camphor, we also detected an unexpected oxygen exchange reaction of primary alcohols, catalyzed by electrophilic ketones such as camphor. The reaction is a displacement of the alcohol OH group by water. This is an example of the usefulness of 17O NMR in the study of a reaction mechanism that has not been noticed previously.",
	"conclusions": "An inexpensive, straightforward method for enriching 17O-labeled water from tap water and the subsequent preparation of 17O-labeled hydrogen peroxide from electrolysis of H2_17O are described in this paper. The fractional distillation method for enrichment of H2_17O reported here can greatly enrich the percentage of H2_17O or H2_18O which are both useful for isotope studies. From approximately 500 mL of 40-fold enriched water, about 90 mL of H2_17O was obtained. The most practical method for determining the enrichment was found to be the reaction of the H2_17O with BSTFA to yield hexamethyldisiloxane which was quantified by GC-MS analysis. Five other 17O-labeled compounds were also prepared from the 17O-labeled water (sodium hydroxide, 1-hexanol, hydrogen peroxide, trimethylsilanol, and camphor) and characterized by NMR and GC-MS. This illustrates the power of 17O NMR in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups. Finally, an unexpected exchange reaction of primary alcohol moieties with water, facilitated by ketones, was detected by 17O NMR."
