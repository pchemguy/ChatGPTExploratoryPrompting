# Typical Structure of Experimental Chemistry Manuscript

RESULT = "OBJECTIVE" + "APPROACH NOVELTY"
For example:
    - **Result**: - `A New Protocol for Industrial Preparation of Hydrogen Peroxide via Controlled Oxidation of Anthraquinone`
        - **Objective**: Development of a New Protocol for Industrial Preparation of Hydrogen Peroxide
        - **Novelty**: Discovered catalytic cycle via controlled oxidation of anthraquinone

- **TITLE**
    - Highlights the main objective of the study, e.g.
        - `Total Synthesis of Coenzyme A`
        - `Investigation of Ethylene Polymerization Mechanism in Presence of Ziegler-Natta Catalyst`
        - `A New Protocol for Industrial Preparation of Hydrogen Peroxide`
    - May also highlight the key experimental technique or approach that enabled achieving the reported result, e.g.,
        - `A New Protocol for Industrial Preparation of Hydrogen Peroxide via Controlled Oxidation of Anthraquinone` 
- **ABSTRACT and CONCLUSIONS**
    Include a brief description / highlights of the main result, additional important results, which may include, for example,
        - **"side results"**, discoveries made during the course of project research that did not contribute directly to achieving / implementation of the main study objective
        - **"supporting results"**, e.g., may provide new or improved solutions to individual steps of the overall protocol, enabling the key result
- **INTRODUCTION**
    - The leading part provides background leading to identification of scientific or technical knowledge gap(s) and explains the significance of potential solutions that would cover identified gap. The main objective of the study would be typically to develop specific solutions to cover the identified gap or to advance knowledge towards development of such solutions.
    - The other part leading to the experimental section describes the achieved results, provides highlights of novel or key techniques / approaches used. May also provide summary of additional / supporting research efforts reported in the manuscript or demonstrated applications of the main result.   
- **EXPERIMENTAL**
    Should provide all essential experimental details that are necessary for independent reproduction of the reported results and their validation (experimental protocols, equipment, any essential modifications to conventional techniques, etc.). Secondary / extended experimental  information is often moved to Supporting Information. Key findings / novelties of experimental manuscripts typically fully disclosed in this section.
- **RESULTS and DISCUSSIONS**
    May contain additional results associated with specific data processing protocols, derived characteristics (results of indirect measurements), new insights from processed data, etc. This is also the place to demonstrate / assess quality of raw data / information, perform validation / consistency checks, select / discuss / justify any theoretical or empirical description / models of the key processes and use selected models for additional validation of the obtained results.
    
    Any nonconventional or modified processing protocol should be described in detail, enabling independent reproduction and validation of claimed results. 
    
    For any highly unusual/revolutionary results/claims, such as
    - demonstrated processes or characteristics that are apparently inconsistent with or contradicting to established knowledge/practices
    - odd results, such as unexpected performance characteristics observed with apparently conventional/established equipment/protocols
    - potentially highly disruptive findings (findings that may )
    a clear and detailed discussion of how specific experimental/processing protocols enabled such results
