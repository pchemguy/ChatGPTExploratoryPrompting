# Typical Structure of Experimental Chemistry Manuscript

- **TITLE**
    - usually highlights the main objective of the study, e.g.
        - `Total Synthesis of Coenzyme A`
        - `Investigation of Ethylene Polymerization Mechanism in Presence of Ziegler-Natta Catalyst`
        - `A New Protocol for Industrial Preparation of Hydrogen Peroxide`
    - may also highlight the key experimental technique or approach that enabled achieving the reported result, e.g.,
        - `A New Protocol for Industrial Preparation of Hydrogen Peroxide via Controlled Oxidation of Anthraquinone` 
- **ABSTRACT and CONCLUSIONS**
    - Include a brief description / highlights of the main result, additional important results, which may include, for example,
        - **"side results"**, discoveries made during the course of project research that did not contribute directly to achieving / implementation of the main study objective
        - **"supporting results"**, e.g., may provide new or improved solutions to individual steps of the overall protocol, enabling the key result
- **INTRODUCTION**
- **RESULTS and DISCUSSIONS**
