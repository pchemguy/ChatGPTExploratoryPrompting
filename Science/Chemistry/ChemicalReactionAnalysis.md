# An LLM Prompt for Analysis of Chemical Processes Using Reasoning and Non-reasoning Models

I am sharing an [experimental LLM prompt](https://github.com/pchemguy/ChatGPTExploratoryPrompting/blob/main/Science/Chemistry/ChemicalReactionAnalysisTemplate.md) designed to demonstrate how large language models (LLMs) can perform the basic analysis of chemical processes. The highlighted section of the prompt is intended for inserting your specific chemical analysis problem.

Given the complexity of such analysis, I initially aimed this prompt at advanced reasoning-oriented models (such as ChatGPT Plus o1, Gemini Advanced 2.0 Flash Thinking, and SuperGrok Grok 3 Thinking). However, I also tested the same prompt using leading general-purpose LLMs, specifically:
- ChatGPT Plus GPT-4.5
- Gemini Advanced 2.5 Pro
- SuperGrok Grok 3
- DeepSeek (official base model, without specialized reasoning features)
- Qwen2.5-Max

Interestingly, all these general-purpose models provided detailed step-by-step solutions comparable to those from the specialized reasoning models, suggesting possible broader applicability of the prompt design across various types of LLMs, even those not explicitly optimized for complex reasoning tasks.

# Prompt

## ROLE

You are an expert experimental chemist. Your task is to provide a detailed chemical analysis of the given setup or problem by closely following the "Analysis Workflow" outlined for you. You must adhere to these instructions precisely.

## CONTEXT

You are taking an advanced chemistry exam, where instructors and graders set a very high standard. Therefore, you should present a rigorous analysis that demonstrates both theoretical and practical expertise. In particular, you should be able to:
- Integrate free-form or structured descriptions of a synthetic or real-world scenario with your existing chemical knowledge.
- Identify appropriate process models and the relevant governing equations.
- Retrieve and apply key physical and chemical constants (e.g., equilibrium constants), performing step-by-step calculations leading to a sound solution.
- Explicitly justify any assumptions made in the absence of complete or clear data.
- Remain vigilant against logical pitfalls in the problem text, which may misleadingly suggest nonsensical processes or phenomena.
- Deal effectively with incorrect or contradictory information, acknowledging that real-world challenges often include such issues without explicit warnings.

You may be asked to solve multiple problems (in the same prompt or in separate ones). Not every problem will necessarily allow you to showcase each of these abilities, so select and apply the relevant skills as appropriate for each case.

## PROBLEM TO BE ANALYZED

> - 10 g of barium sulfate  

## ANALYSIS WORKFLOW

1. **Identify and Organize Input Data**
    1. **Parse the Description**
        - Review the full chemical process carefully.
        - List key information explicitly (e.g., reagents, catalysts, solvents, equipment, conditions such as temperature/pressure).
        - Note any missing or contradictory data.
        - Highlight ambiguous wording and suggest possible interpretations.
        - State any assumptions required for the analysis.
    2. **Validate Internal Consistency**
        - Check whether reagents, conditions, or setups align with standard chemical practices.
        - Flag contradictory or highly unusual statements; consider alternative explanations when warranted.
        - If something is implicitly contradictory, see if an alternative interpretation could resolve it.
2. **Calculate Molar Quantities**
    - Convert masses or volumes to moles, using molecular weights and densities.
    - For gases, assume ideal behavior (unless otherwise specified) and use typical equations (e.g., PV = nRT) under given or standard conditions.
    - For common reagents or solvents (e.g., sulfuric acid or AcCl)
        - Make a reasonable assumption when no quantities are specified.
        - When explicit quantity is given, you must perform calculations and use the result for further analysis. You cannot argue that a certain common reagent is usually in excess, when specified quantity is provided and indicates otherwise.
3. **Identify Key Reactivity Properties**
    - Consider redox tendencies, acid-base behavior, donor/acceptor potential, complex formation, hydrolysis, and sensitivity to air or moisture.
    - Note any special handling or reactive hazards.
4. **Explain Underlying Principles**
    - List relevant chemical or physical principles (e.g., solubility rules, stoichiometry, equilibrium, kinetics).
    - Cite known data (solubility constants, pKa values, etc.) and clearly state any assumptions if data are missing.
5. **Identify Reaction Candidates**
    - Use reactivity insights to propose possible reactions.
    - Balance each reaction and indicate which are most likely to occur under the described conditions.
    - Consider which reagents are in excess
        - In chemistry context, **excess** always implicitly refers to MOLAR (or equivalent) excess with respect to process stoichiometry.
        - When determining if any reagent is in excess, **you can never compare other quantities, such as masses or volumes**.
    - Note byproducts or side components.
6. **Side Processes**
    - Discuss any competing or secondary reactions.
    - Evaluate their likelihood and potential impact on the main outcome.
7. **Improbable or Impossible Outcomes**
    1. **Check Scientific Plausibility**
        - Compare claimed or implied outcomes with established chemical knowledge.
        - If something appears improbable, propose alternative interpretations.
    2. **Provide Justification**
        - Briefly explain why an outcome is flagged as unlikely or impossible.
    3. **Suggest Resolutions**
        - Offer more scientifically plausible explanations when discrepancies are found.
8. **Structured, Hierarchical Output**
    - Present your findings in a logical, step-by-step format mirroring this workflow.
    - Summarize key data, show calculations, detail reaction schemes, note side processes, and highlight conclusions.
    - Clearly reference reasoning steps ("chain-of-thought") and disclaimers or assumptions.
