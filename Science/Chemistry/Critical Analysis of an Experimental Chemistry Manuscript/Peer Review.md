# Q

**Persona:**
You are an expert Prompt Engineer.

**Task:**
Develop a robust deep research prompt.

**Research Topic:**

Academic peer review guides for journals in experimental chemistry and physics.

**Context:**

The peer review skills are often passed as tacit knowledge. The relevant education of the peer review process for reviewers perhaps involves the flow: "learn to read papers by reading" -> "learn to write by writing" -> "learn to review by reviewing".

I am interested in specific resources teaching scholarly peer review process to reviewers or actionable guides providing specific detailed instructions by a young scholar who has never performed peer review and have not been provided any prior guidance. I acknowledge that a sufficiently detailed guide cannot be subject agnostic, so I am particularly interested in experimental journals in chemistry, physical chemistry (including instrumentation development) and physics.

While the quality of such guides should stand on its own without regard to their origin, and I am interested in such guides, I am also specifically interested specific guides published by reputable scholarly publishers (e.g., Springer or Elsevier),journal (e.g., JACS, ACS Physical Chemistry xxx, ACS Analytical Chemistry, JMR, Journal of Chemical Physics xxx, etc.), and libraries of university libraries - top performers in STEM (MIT, Caltech, Harvard, Stanford, etc.; probably, primarily in the edu domain, though this is not an absolute requirement).

**Deep Research Prompt: Actionable Peer Review Guides for Novice Experimental Chemists & Physicists**

**Objective:** Identify and retrieve specific, actionable, and detailed guides, tutorials, checklists, or training materials on performing academic peer review, specifically targeted towards or highly suitable for early-career researchers (Ph.D. students, postdocs) with little to no prior peer review experience.

**Context:** The traditional "learn by doing" approach to peer review often lacks explicit instruction. This research aims to find resources that bridge this gap by providing concrete guidance, moving beyond general principles to offer step-by-step instructions or detailed criteria applicable to evaluating manuscripts.

**Subject Domain Focus:**
- Experimental Chemistry (including Organic, Inorganic, Materials)
- Physical Chemistry (including Spectroscopy, Kinetics, Thermodynamics, Surface Science)
- Analytical Chemistry (particularly concerning instrumentation and experimental methodology)
- Experimental Physics (Condensed Matter, Optics, Atomic/Molecular/Optical (AMO), Applied Physics, Instrumentation Development)
- Interdisciplinary areas heavily involving experimental work in these fields (e.g., Chemical Physics, Materials Science).

**Key Requirements for Resources:**
1. **Actionability:** Must provide practical steps, specific questions to ask, or clear criteria for evaluating different sections of a manuscript (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusion, Figures, References).
2. **Target Audience Suitability:** Explicitly aimed at new reviewers OR detailed enough to be easily followed by someone without prior experience or tacit knowledge.
3. **Discipline Specificity:** Content should be relevant to the norms and common manuscript structures within _experimental_ chemistry and physics journals. Avoid purely theoretical, computational, or social science-focused guides unless the principles are demonstrably transferable and highly detailed.
4. **Format:** Open to various formats including webpages, downloadable PDFs, checklists, recorded webinars (if transcripts/summaries available), online course modules.

**Specific Search Areas & Source Prioritization:**
1. **High-Priority Publishers:** Systematically search resource/author/reviewer centers for:
    - Elsevier
    - Springer Nature (including Nature portfolio)
    - Wiley
    - American Chemical Society (ACS) Publications
    - Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC)
    - American Institute of Physics (AIP) Publishing
    - American Physical Society (APS)
    - Taylor & Francis
    - Institute of Physics (IOP) Publishing
2. **High-Priority Journals (Reviewer Guideline Sections):** Investigate "Information for Reviewers," "Reviewer Guidelines," or similar sections for specific journals like:
    - _ACS:_ JACS, ACS Central Science, Analytical Chemistry, Journal of Physical Chemistry (A/B/C/Letters), ACS Nano, Chemistry of Materials, Organic Letters, Inorganic Chemistry.
    - _AIP/APS:_ Journal of Chemical Physics, Applied Physics Letters, Physical Review Letters, Physical Review B/Applied/Materials, Review of Scientific Instruments.
    - _Elsevier/Springer/Wiley/RSC/etc.:_ Chemical Science, Angewandte Chemie, Advanced Materials, Journal of Materials Research (JMR), Surface Science, Chemical Physics Letters, relevant experimental physics journals.
3. **Top STEM University Libraries & Writing Centers:** Search websites (prioritizing `.edu` domains, especially library, research office, or writing center subdomains) of institutions known for strong experimental science programs:
    - MIT
    - Caltech
    - Stanford
    - Harvard
    - UC Berkeley
    - Cornell
    - Princeton
    - University of Cambridge
    - ETH Zurich
    - (Include others relevant to specific sub-fields if known)
    - _Search terms:_ "peer review guide," "how to review manuscript," "reviewer training," "scholarly publishing guide," "research ethics review."
4. **Scholarly Societies & Organizations:** Explore resources provided by discipline-specific societies beyond their publishing arms (e.g., general resources from ACS, APS, RSC).
5. **General Search (Quality Filter):** Conduct broader web searches but apply strict filters for actionability and relevance to experimental sciences. Look for guides potentially hosted on personal academic pages, research group sites, or non-profit organizations focused on research integrity/publishing (e.g., COPE - Committee on Publication Ethics, while often policy-focused, may link to training).

**Keywords & Search Strings (Examples - Combine and Modify):**
- `"guide for peer reviewers" + "experimental chemistry"`
- `"how to review a scientific paper" + "physical chemistry" + checklist`
- `"reviewer guidelines" + "physics journal" + detailed`
- `"training for new reviewers" + ACS OR Elsevier OR Springer OR AIP OR APS`
- `site:.edu "peer review" + "STEM" OR "science" + instructions OR template`
- `"evaluating research methods" + "peer review" + chemistry`
- `"writing a peer review report" + physics + template OR example`
- `"Journal of Chemical Physics" + "information for reviewers"`
- `"Review of Scientific Instruments" + "reviewer guide"`
- `"actionable peer review advice" + experimental`

**Output:** Collate identified resources, including direct links, source (publisher, journal, university), a brief description highlighting actionable elements, and format (PDF, webpage, etc.). Note if the resource is explicitly discipline-specific or more general but highly applicable.

# RQ

Let's extend the source list. As far as journals are concerns, the search should target not only reviewer guidelines sections, but also the publications themselves, as sometimes the peer review process becomes the actual subject of formal scholarly research, with results presented as scholarly publications.

# A2

**Deep Research Prompt: Actionable Peer Review Guides & Research for Novice Experimental Chemists & Physicists**

**Objective:** Identify and retrieve specific, actionable resources (guides, tutorials, checklists, training materials) **AND** relevant scholarly publications (research articles, reviews, perspectives, editorials) that offer insights or guidance on performing academic peer review. The focus remains on resources suitable for early-career researchers (Ph.D. students, postdocs) in experimental sciences with limited prior review experience.

**Context:** Recognizing that peer review skills are often underdeveloped through formal training, this research seeks both explicit instructional materials and insights derived from formal research _into_ the peer review process itself. The goal is to find concrete guidance applicable to evaluating experimental work, moving beyond general principles.

**Subject Domain Focus:**
- Experimental Chemistry (including Organic, Inorganic, Materials)
- Physical Chemistry (including Spectroscopy, Kinetics, Thermodynamics, Surface Science)
- Analytical Chemistry (particularly concerning instrumentation and experimental methodology)
- Experimental Physics (Condensed Matter, Optics, Atomic/Molecular/Optical (AMO), Applied Physics, Instrumentation Development)
