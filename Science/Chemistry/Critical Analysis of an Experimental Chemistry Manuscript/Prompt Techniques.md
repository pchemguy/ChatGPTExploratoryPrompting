  Classification can be ad-hoc, but they should make general sense. For a new/ad-hoc classification, develop a description and include one as part of a prompt. Ask model to perform classification. Develop specific questions or instructions based on classifications.

- Tell LLM constraints, such as when particular kind of information must be ignored under certain circumstances
- Talk to LLM like to a person
