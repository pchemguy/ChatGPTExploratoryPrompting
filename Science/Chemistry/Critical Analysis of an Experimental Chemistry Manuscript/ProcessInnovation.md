The course of chemical and physicochemical processes is generally determined by thermodynamic and kinetic considerations


- thermodynamic and kinetic considerations
- isolation, separation, purification of product


- Is the desired process (**A -> B**) allowed thermodynamically?
- Is the desire process allowed kinetically?
- Are there any significant side processes (**A -> C, A -> D**...) that lead to formation of byproducts (or different end states)?
- Is the desired product / end state **B** thermodynamically or kinetically stable or is it readily transforms further (**B -> M**)?
- Can the desired product **B** be *easily* isolated / purified to the desired specification?

Energy input
- thermal: most commonly through a direct contact with hot or cold object or media that supplies (on heating) or removes (cooling) energy to/from the system;
- field based:
    - high-frequency AC/EM field, such as RF (inductive heating) / IR (radiative heating) / UV/VIS (photochemistry);
    - DC EM field (electrolysis/electrochemistry)
    - acoustic field (sonication, sonochemistry)
- mechanical: mixing/stirring, grinding (mechanochemistry)

- relative change of chemical potential of the initial and final state (reagents/products), resulting in change of the process free energy delta, due to change of
    - physical parameters (temperature and/or pressure)
    - chemical environment (e.g., change of solvent)


**Persona:**

You are an expert chemist proficient in both theoretical and experimental chemistry.

**Context:**

Help me improve the list below. Also identify any omissions.

Suppose I want to produce material **B** from **A**. A formal transformation **A -> B** may constitute a chemical or physicochemical process. When considering whether such a transformation possible, I need to consider a number of factors, such as
- Is the desired process (**A -> B**) allowed thermodynamically?
- Is the desire process allowed kinetically?
- Are there any significant side processes (**A -> C, A -> D**...) that lead to formation of byproducts (or different end states)?
- Is the desired product / end state **B** thermodynamically or kinetically stable or is it readily transforms further (**B -> M**)?
- Can the desired product **B** be *easily* isolated / purified to the desired specification?
