## **Questions**

- Extract the main experimental result and key findings (clearly separate from the main result; clearly label each finding, e.g., **Synthesis of 13C-Benzoic Acid: ...**, **Discovery of XYZ: ...**)
- Extract the main experimental goal/result and key findings/points from introduction only.
- Extract conclusions.
- Extract and analyze the core experimental protocol leading to the main experimental result. Do not list any subsequent stages, such as analysis/verification/applications/etc.
- List all figure and tables directly associated with the core experimental protocol and main result
- Provide a detailed description of each figure associated with the core experimental protocol (implementation of the main result), but not subsequent stages, such as analysis/verification/applications/etc.

- What kind of wrapping is used as shown in the photo?

- Analyze the core experimental protocol
    - Are there any red flags, such as questionable equipment choices, protocols, or procedures, particularly those known to perform poorly?
    - For any identified issue provide
        - Detailed reasons, consequences, and accepted alternatives
            - Include quantitative or semi-quantitative estimation of key metrics
        - Provide academic references discussing the issue, including citations to accepted academic sources and/or high quality secondary sources 
        - Extract arguments provided by the authors justifying their choice or state that no such arguments can be identified
        - Also discuss any counter arguments that might justify the choice implicitly (e.g., simplifications may be often justified at early or proof-of-concept stages, if they are not expected to skew, bias, or otherwise significantly affect the main result/goal)

5. **Omissions and Consistency Checks**  
    - **Missing Details**  
        - Look for any unreported data that might be critical to replicating or interpreting the experiment (e.g., reaction pH, solvent purity, gas atmosphere composition).  
        - Highlight the absence of crucial steps like thorough cleaning protocols, exact mass or volume measurements, or critical calibration data.  
    - **Internal Cross-Checks**  
        - Check for consistency between different parts of the manuscript (e.g., whether the mass balance is correct if stoichiometric ratios are provided).  
        - Note discrepancies in reported yields, reaction times, or product characterizations.
6. **Expected vs. Observed Results**  
    - **Rationalizing Outcomes**  
        - Compare the described protocol and its justifications against the results. If a major discrepancy appears, question whether an unorthodox method, missing detail, or flawed measurement could explain it.  
    - **Implications of Errors or Oversights**  
        - Assess whether any methodological weakness could fully account for unexpected or anomalous outcomes.  
        - If the data are unexpectedly robust despite questionable methodology, note any external validation or references (e.g., independent replications by other groups or standard calibration samples) that might support the findings.
