# Classification System for Experimental-Chemistry Papers

## Core

Below is a suggested “flat” classification system for experimental-chemistry papers, expanded and refined from the original seed list. Each paper should be assigned to exactly one category, based on the *primary* focus or motivation of its reported research (that is, the key problem, concept, or goal). Ancillary activities (e.g. characterization data simply to confirm a synthesis) do not change the classification; they matter only if they are the main point of the paper.

### Proposed High-Level Classes

1. **Methodology or Protocol Development**  
   - **Focus:** Proposing, refining, or validating new methods, protocols, or instruments/techniques (whether experimental or computational) used by chemists.  
   - **Examples:**  
     - A new procedure for handling extremely sensitive reagents in the lab  
     - Introduction of a greener or safer experimental setup  
     - A novel analytical or instrumental protocol (e.g., a new electrochemical setup)

2. **New Synthetic Pathway or Reaction**  
   - **Focus:** Discovering or optimizing a reaction, or devising a new synthetic route (often to known targets, but the core novelty lies in how they are synthesized).  
   - **Examples:**  
     - A publication on total synthesis of a complex natural product emphasizing the route’s novelty or improvements in yield  
     - A paper detailing a novel catalytic reaction that can be applied broadly

3. **New Molecular Compound (“Base Compound”)**  
   - **Focus:** Designing or producing a *new, individual chemical entity*—the compound itself is the breakthrough (rather than the route to it). Often discussed in context of pharmaceutical or functional property discovery.  
   - **Examples:**  
     - A new small-molecule drug candidate with a previously unreported scaffold  
     - A novel organometallic complex with unique catalytic or electronic properties

4. **New Material (e.g. Composites, Polymers, Frameworks)**  
   - **Focus:** Creating or discovering new bulk materials, composites, polymers, metal-organic frameworks, etc. The novelty lies in the *material* and its emergent properties, not simply in an individual molecule.  
   - **Examples:**  
     - A novel metal-organic framework for gas capture  
     - A new carbon-based composite with improved mechanical or thermal properties

5. **Testing or Elucidating a Theory or Hypothesis**  
   - **Focus:** Probing mechanistic questions, fundamental phenomena, or specific theoretical models. The paper’s main claim revolves around *confirming, refuting, or refining* a hypothesis/theory.  
   - **Examples:**  
     - Mechanistic study determining the pathway of a catalytic reaction  
     - Fundamental experiments aimed at validating a theoretical model of electron transfer  
     - Investigations into reaction intermediates to understand reactivity principles

6. **Characterizing New or Existing Compounds**  
   - **Focus:** Primarily concerned with obtaining new experimental data on structures, spectra, or properties (physical, chemical, biological, etc.) of substances. The novelty is in the *characterization data* itself or in clarifying/confirming previously uncertain properties.  
   - **Examples:**  
     - Determination of a precise crystal structure for a known but poorly characterized complex  
     - Re-measurement or refinement of spectral/physical data that corrects the record for an important compound

7. **Industrial or Applied Processes**  
   - **Focus:** Large-scale or application-driven research (e.g. scale-up, process design, or direct industrial usage). Novelty centers on how the chemistry translates into a practical, industrial, or real-world context (rather than on the fundamental chemistry per se).  
   - **Examples:**  
     - Optimizing an existing reaction to be more cost-efficient or greener in an industrial plant  
     - Pilot-scale demonstrations of a new process intensification method  
     - Research tailored to immediate commercial/engineering problems (e.g. continuous-flow processes for mass production)

### Notes and Guidance

- **Pick exactly one category** by identifying the paper’s *primary driver*. For instance, if a paper synthesizes a new drug candidate primarily to highlight the *synthetic route*, then that paper belongs in “New Synthetic Pathway,” not “New Molecular Compound.” Conversely, if the significance is the *compound’s* novel structure or function (and the route is only moderately interesting), then pick “New Molecular Compound.”  
- **Ancillary methods** (e.g., computational analyses or routine measurements used to confirm a new route) do not change the paper’s category; they belong in “Methodology” only when those techniques themselves are the primary research outcome.  
- **Basic/fundamental vs. applied/industrial** can often be distinguished by the problem statement. If the core question is about “how or why” (mechanistic or conceptual), see “Testing a Theory or Hypothesis.” If the core driver is scale, cost, or engineering feasibility, see “Industrial or Applied Processes.”  
- **New vs. known compound** distinction arises in categories “New Molecular Compound” (the substance truly *did not exist* or is entirely unreported) vs. “Characterizing…Compounds” (the compound may be known, but new data or properties are being revealed).

This scheme should allow one to categorize most experimental-chemistry papers at a glance by focusing on the paper’s *primary purpose and novelty*.

## Extra

Below are a few additional “purely optional” categories that some groups find helpful. Whether you add them depends on how broadly or granularly you want to classify. In many cases, these might fit as subcategories or special cases of your existing items (e.g., under “Methodology” or “Industrial/Applied”), but they can be broken out if you regularly encounter a critical mass of papers in these areas.

---

### 8. Analytical or Instrumentation-Focused Studies
- **When to Use:** If the main novelty is a *new measurement or detection method*, an innovative instrument setup, or an analytical protocol *that does not primarily serve to validate a synthesis but stands on its own*.  
- **Notes:**
  - Can be viewed as a subcategory of “Methodology or Protocol Development” if you prefer fewer top-level classes.
  - Use this category only if the real *point* of the paper is the new or improved method of measurement. Otherwise, if the measurement/analysis is just routine to confirm a new compound/reaction, stay with “New Compound” or “New Synthetic Pathway,” etc.

---

### 9. Environmental or Green Chemistry / Remediation-Focused Studies
- **When to Use:** The research primarily aims at *addressing an environmental problem*—for example:
  - Developing or testing new approaches for pollution remediation
  - Investigating the fate of chemicals in the environment
  - Developing “green” synthetic protocols with explicit environmental metrics as the main driver
- **Notes:**
  - If the main thrust is simply a greener route for making a known compound (and the big claim is “we have an improved, eco-friendly synthesis”), some teams classify that under “Industrial or Applied Processes.” If, however, the emphasis is on *environmental impact* or *remediation outcomes*, you might give it its own high-level label.
  - This category helps separate environmentally oriented research from purely economic/scale-up industrial studies.

---

### 10. Bio-/Pharmacologically Focused Studies (If Distinct from “New Compound”)
- **When to Use:** If the *core* novelty is a biological or pharmacological application/assay for an already known compound or for a set of compounds—i.e., the chemistry is experimental but the spotlight is truly on the *biological testing, mechanism of action in living systems, or medicinal effect*.  
- **Notes:**
  - Sometimes these are covered under “Testing or Elucidating a Theory or Hypothesis,” but if you routinely handle a large body of purely biological/pharmacological experiments (such as drug mechanism-of-action studies, toxicology, or in vivo experiments), you may want a separate category for it.
  - If, however, the paper’s main novelty is the *chemical structure* of a new drug candidate, that is still “New Molecular Compound.”

---

### 11. Educational/Pedagogical Studies (Less Common in Research-Focused Classifications)
- **When to Use:** If the paper’s fundamental contribution is to describe a new *experimental curriculum* or an educational technique for teaching chemistry labs.  
- **Notes:**
  - This category is not always included in technical research classifications, but it can be helpful if you also track chemistry-education research.

---

### How to Decide If You Need These

- If you hardly ever see papers dedicated exclusively to new analytical instrumentation or green/environmental chem, you might just fold them into **Methodology** or **Industrial/Applied** as appropriate.  
- If, on the other hand, such papers are a major piece of your literature stream, and it’s important to highlight them distinctly (e.g., you have an entire environmental-chem division), giving them their own top-level slot can make your classification more informative.

Otherwise, the **seven** broad categories you already have are often enough for a high-level, flat taxonomy.
