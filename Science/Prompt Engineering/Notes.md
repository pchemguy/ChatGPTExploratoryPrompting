Focus on #1. I need to refine the task. After the second bullet, the next step is to identify any multistep procedures, such as multistep extraction, multistage synthesis, or dynamic nuclear polarization involving polarization as the first step, and NMR as the second step. All such processes needs to be split down to "elementary" experimental step stage. The main point here is that it needs to be possible to identify/specify the before/after state (input to/output from). For each such step all relevant details must be extracted as well, so that theoretical predictions about the after/output could be made whenever possible based on such description and before/input to verify that the reported data is intrinsically consistent, as discussed in "2. Context and Desired Output".
