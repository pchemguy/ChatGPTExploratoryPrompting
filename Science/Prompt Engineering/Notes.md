Focus on #1. I need to refine the task. After the second bullet, the next step is to identify any multistep procedures, such as multistep extraction, multistage synthesis, or dynamic nuclear polarization involving polarization as the first step, and NMR as the second step. All such processes needs to be split down to "elementary" experimental step stage. The main point here is that it needs to be possible to identify/specify the before/after state (input to/output from). For each such step all relevant details must be extracted as well, so that theoretical predictions about the after/output could be made whenever possible based on such description and before/input to verify that the reported data is intrinsically consistent, as discussed in "2. Context and Desired Output".


Let's expand section "1. Primary Task and Goals" by providing explicit instructions regarding dealing with ambiguous or missing information.

While an ideal scientific manuscript must provide all information necessary to validate reported research activities and evaluate the accuracy of the results, most real manuscript provide incomplete or inaccurate information for various reasons. An important component of the review process is to identify any missing or ambiguous information and clearly indicate why such information is necessary. The most common reason would be missing information necessary to provide sufficient details for all experimental procedures so that appropriate theoretical or phenomenological treatment of each individual stage is possible, enabling prediction of expected outcome for comparison with reported results. If any relevant parameters about the before/after states for any elementary stage or process, such as compositions,  quantities, catalysts, temperature, pressure, etc. are missing or ambiguous, independent theoretical or experimental validation of such stage becomes problematic. Make sure to point to specific places in the manuscript, where ambiguous or otherwise defective information is located; for missing information, identify the most logical primary location in the manuscript, where it fits best.

In addition to identifying any missing information, it is essential to analyze the manuscript carefully to see if missing information might be inferred. For example, the text might indicate the amount of material produced as the output of certain intermediate stage. The text may not provide information as to how much material was used as input for a subsequent stage, but it might be possible to infer if all material or a certain fraction was used. Alternatively, the information about intermediate output quantity may not be provided explicitly, but the experimental details may indicate:
- a certain relation with respect to the provided input (forward inference from stage's input);
- that the entire output was split in a certain way for subsequent stages, so that backwards inference might be possible based on the input quantities used in the immediately subsequent stages/experiments.
When any such inferences can be made, perform the necessary estimations/assumptions, extract information, and clearly indicate any assumptions/calculations necessary to extract this information, what reported information was used as a starting point for any calculations / estimations, as well as point to specific places
