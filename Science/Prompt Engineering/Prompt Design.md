# Q

Explain if the following description matches a known approach and improve the language/vocabulary to match accepted terminology and description approaches.

Requested template prompt structure aims to implement an extended CoT algorithm. For best result, the target task of manuscript analysis is split into "sub-prompts" each providing a detailed description of specific subtasks. The level of fragmentation of the task and description of subtasks aims to ensure that reasoning models employing CoT internally should handle individual subtasks reliably, while the entire series of sub-prompts implement a higher level guided CoT process with RAG-like modification (structured outputs of previous sub-prompts are provided as attachments, so that later sub-prompts could refer to those outputs.

Here is an **updated, more formal** description of the multi-step prompt structure and its relation to known large language model (LLM) prompting strategies:

### **Refined Explanation**

The described method **does** align with several well-recognized approaches in the field of LLM prompting and reasoning:

1. **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)**  
   - Typically, a single prompt elicits the model’s step-by-step reasoning (“chain of thought”) in a continuous manner.  
   - By splitting the overall manuscript analysis into **sequentially ordered sub-prompts**, each addressing a specific subtask, the process enforces a type of **structured CoT** or **“stepped” CoT**.  
   - This design effectively breaks down a complex review task (analyzing an entire manuscript) into *manageable components*, which reduces error and helps maintain coherent reasoning at each step.

2. **Hierarchical or Decomposition Prompting**  
   - In addition to CoT, researchers often use **task decomposition**—that is, **subdividing** a large problem into smaller tasks—so each sub-prompt can focus on a narrowly scoped objective (e.g., extracting experimental details, listing reagents, or checking internal consistency).  
   - This approach is closely related to “decompose-then-solve” prompting, which has proven advantageous in ensuring reliable, high-quality outputs on each subset of the overall problem.

3. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-Like Modifications**  
   - The *structured outputs* from earlier sub-prompts are provided as **attachments** in subsequent sub-prompts, serving as an **internal reference** or knowledge base for the next stage.  
   - While classical RAG pipelines often involve retrieving from an external database, the principle here is similar: each subsequent step “retrieves” relevant facts or structured data (e.g., JSON outputs) generated in earlier steps.  
   - This *re-injection* of prior outputs helps ensure continuity and consistency throughout the entire chain of reasoning—much like an LLM retrieving relevant information from stored memory or a vector database in a standard RAG flow.

Overall, this **multi-step, sub-prompt approach** can be viewed as a **guided, modular extension** of chain-of-thought reasoning combined with a retrieval-like mechanism. Each sub-prompt enforces a rigorous focus on one aspect of the manuscript, then hands off a structured “knowledge artifact” (e.g., JSON output) to the next step. In doing so, the entire process becomes **systematic, verifiable, and less prone to error**, while ensuring that the final conclusions (regarding feasibility, internal consistency, or plausibility of the manuscript’s results) are grounded in carefully compiled evidence from prior subtasks.

### **Improved Terminology & Description**

- **Extended Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting**  
  > “We employ a multi-stage approach in which each sub-prompt elicits a structured chain-of-thought for a specific component of the overall task (e.g., extracting experimental details, identifying contradictions). The outputs of each sub-prompt are then used as reference points in subsequent prompts.”

- **Hierarchical Sub-Prompt Decomposition**  
  > “The task is broken into discrete subtasks, each described in a dedicated sub-prompt that includes detailed instructions, a predefined output format, and any relevant context from prior steps.”

- **RAG-Inspired Reference Provision**  
  > “To ensure consistency and continuity, the generated data from earlier subtasks (e.g., `subtask_1.json`) is attached to later subtasks. This setup parallels retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), where earlier outputs function as an internal knowledge resource for subsequent reasoning steps.”

---

In sum, the **requested template prompt structure** is a recognized, **effective methodology** for leveraging an LLM’s chain-of-thought capabilities in a **stepwise**, **retrieval-like** fashion, ensuring that **each subtask** is handled thoroughly and systematically, and that **all** analysis ultimately feeds into a well-substantiated final conclusion.
