# Q

Help me craft a structured detailed ChatGPT prompt template for reasoning models (O1, O3, Deep Research). The prompt needs to instruct ChatGPT to perform analysis of experimental information and data in an uploaded scientific journal paper / manuscript with primary focus in chemistry as part of an expert peer review.

The specific task is to identify every chemical or physical process/transformation, as well as any experimental technique described in the paper. Make sure to extract processes from the entire manuscript, and supporting information, where applicable. Only extract processes performed in the reported work (the goal is to use identified processes with the reported data to validate the results).

Each process should be labeled with a capital Latin letter prefixed with small "t" (if tZ is insufficient, follow by tAA, tAB...). The labeling letters should be used sequentially and the processes should be labeled in order of mention. ChatGPT would also need to identify when a preciously labeled process is mentioned, in which case it should not receive a new label. If process is physically used more than once, each use gets its own label. Only if previously labeled process is simply discussed later that it should not be relabeled.
