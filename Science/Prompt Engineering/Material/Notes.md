Focus on #1. I need to refine the task. After the second bullet, the next step is to identify any multistep procedures, such as multistep extraction, multistage synthesis, or dynamic nuclear polarization involving polarization as the first step, and NMR as the second step. All such processes needs to be split down to "elementary" experimental step stage. The main point here is that it needs to be possible to identify/specify the before/after state (input to/output from). For each such step all relevant details must be extracted as well, so that theoretical predictions about the after/output could be made whenever possible based on such description and before/input to verify that the reported data is intrinsically consistent, as discussed in "2. Context and Desired Output".

Let's expand section "1. Primary Task and Goals" by providing explicit instructions regarding dealing with ambiguous, missing, or inconsistent information. While an ideal scientific manuscript must provide all information necessary to validate reported research activities and evaluate the accuracy of the results, most real manuscript provide incomplete or inaccurate information for various reasons. An important component of the review process is to clearly explain
* what information is incomplete or inaccurate;
* why missing information is necessary;
* what evidences indicate that particular information is inaccurate or inconsistent. 

Perhaps, the most common issue for experiment-based reports is insufficient experimental details necessary for appropriate theoretical or phenomenological treatment of each individual stage and using such treatment for predicting processes outcomes for comparison with reported results. If any relevant parameters (such as compositions, quantities, catalysts, temperature, pressure, etc.) about the before/after states of any elementary stage or process are missing or ambiguous, independent theoretical or experimental validation of such stage becomes problematic. Therefore, it is important to identify all such issues and point to specific places in the manuscript, where ambiguous or otherwise defective information is located; for missing information, the most logical primary location in the manuscript, where it fits best, should be pointed.

In addition to identifying any missing information, it is essential to analyze the manuscript carefully to see if missing information might be inferred. For example, the text might indicate the amount of material produced as the output of a certain intermediate stage, but not provide information as to how much material was used as input for subsequent stages. In such a case mass balance considerations may possibly provide a way to infer missing information if text indicates or suggests that all material or a certain fraction was used in a subsequent process (forward inference from stage's input). Alternatively, the information about intermediate output quantity may not be provided explicitly, but the experimental details may indicate that the entire output was split in a certain way for subsequent stages, so that backwards inference might be possible based on the input quantities used in the immediately subsequent stages/experiments or even in further downstream processes by recursive backtracking where appropriate.

When any such inferences can be made, perform the necessary estimations/assumptions, extract information, and clearly indicate any assumptions/calculations necessary to extract this information, what reported information (and its specific location in the manuscript) was used as a starting point for any calculations / estimations. Clearly indicate where explicitly stated information appears to be sufficient to recover missing information of if additional reasonable assumptions must be made.

- Consistency check by propagated inferences and matching alternative, but related characteristics
- Perhaps, use different letter labels for various components at different stages (similar to chemical problems)
- Associate each labeled substance and transformation with corresponding characteristics  (make tables?)
- Graphs / schematics of different processes
- Use constructed graphs to identify any missing or redundant information and use such information for subsequent information recovery or consistency checks
- Model / governing equation identification
