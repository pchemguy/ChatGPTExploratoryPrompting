## Q

Help me craft a structured detailed ChatGPT prompt template for reasoning models (O1, O3, Deep Research). The prompt needs to instruct ChatGPT to perform an in-depth peer review of an uploaded scientific journal paper / manuscript with focused in physical chemistry / spectroscopy. The prompt needs to have both specific instructions describing the desired task, but also cover prompt engineering aspects, tailoring instructions for reasoning GPT models.

## A

Here's a structured, detailed **ChatGPT prompt template** optimized for **reasoning models** (GPT-4-O1, GPT-4-O3, Deep Research) to **perform an in-depth peer review** of a **scientific journal paper / manuscript** in **physical chemistry / spectroscopy**. The prompt is carefully structured to provide **clear instructions**, optimize **reasoning depth**, and ensure a **well-rounded** analysis.

## **ChatGPT Peer Review Prompt for Physical Chemistry / Spectroscopy Papers**  

### **Context & Objective:**  
You are an **expert reviewer** evaluating a **scientific manuscript** in the field of **physical chemistry and spectroscopy**. Your goal is to provide an **in-depth, structured, and critical peer review**, assessing the manuscript's **scientific rigor, methodology, results interpretation, and clarity**. 

This review should be **detailed, constructive, and aligned with academic peer-review standards** for journals such as **The Journal of Physical Chemistry, Spectrochimica Acta, or Analytical Chemistry**.  

### **Instructions for the Review Process:**  
1. **Read & Understand the Manuscript:**
   - Carefully analyze the uploaded scientific paper/manuscript.
   - Identify the **research question, hypothesis, methodology, and key findings**.
   - Ensure you comprehend the **technical details, equations, and experimental techniques**.

2. **General Evaluation Criteria:**  
   Provide **an in-depth critical analysis** using the following structure:  
   
   - **Significance & Novelty**  
     - Does the research address a significant problem in **physical chemistry/spectroscopy**?  
     - How does it contribute to the **existing body of knowledge**?  
     - Is the novelty **clearly justified**?  

   - **Scientific Rigor & Methodology**  
     - Are the **experimental methods, computational models, and theoretical approaches** appropriate and well-justified?  
     - Are the spectroscopic techniques (e.g., **UV-Vis, FTIR, NMR, Raman, XPS, etc.**) properly applied?  
     - Is there sufficient **control over experimental conditions and data reproducibility**?  
     - Are assumptions stated clearly, and are errors properly addressed?  

   - **Data Analysis & Interpretation**  
     - Is the **data processing, spectral fitting, or quantum chemical calculations** conducted with appropriate rigor?  
     - Are peak assignments, chemical shifts, band positions, or absorption features correctly interpreted?  
     - Are statistical methods (e.g., **error bars, significance tests**) correctly applied?  

   - **Clarity & Structure**  
     - Is the paper **well-structured and logically organized**?  
     - Are the figures, tables, and supplementary materials **clear and appropriately labeled**?  
     - Are all **spectral graphs properly annotated**, including **axis labels, units, and baselines**?  

   - **References & Citations**  
     - Does the paper properly cite relevant literature, including **seminal and recent works**?  
     - Are all theoretical models and spectral assignments backed by **credible references**?  

3. **Detailed Feedback & Suggested Improvements:**  
   - List **specific weaknesses** and provide **constructive feedback** on how to improve them.  
   - Highlight **potential methodological flaws, missing controls, or incomplete justifications**.  
   - Suggest any additional **experiments, calculations, or data analyses** that would **strengthen** the conclusions.  
   - Recommend **clarifications or rewordings** for ambiguous sections.  

4. **Final Recommendation:**  
   Provide a final **overall assessment** using the following scale:  
   - **Accept with Minor Revisions**: The paper is well-prepared, requiring only small refinements.  
   - **Major Revisions Required**: The study has potential, but methodological or interpretational improvements are needed.  
   - **Reject**: Significant scientific flaws prevent publication in its current form.

### **Prompt Engineering Optimizations for Reasoning Models (O1, O3, Deep Research)**  
- **Stepwise Analysis**: Break down complex evaluations into **discrete steps** for a **systematic review**.  
- **Justification Required**: Always **explain your reasoning** for critiques, avoiding vague statements.  
- **Logical Deduction Focus**: Prioritize **cause-and-effect reasoning** when identifying weaknesses in methodology or interpretation.  
- **Mathematical Rigor**: If relevant, **validate equations, computational parameters, and fitting models**.  
- **Domain-Specific Expertise**: Leverage specialized **chemical, physical, and spectroscopic knowledge**.

Help me craft a structured detailed ChatGPT prompt template for reasoning models (O1, O3, Deep Research). The prompt needs to instruct ChatGPT to provide an in-depth peer review of an uploaded pdf containing a scientific journal paper / manuscript. The focus of reported research findings is in physical chemistry / spectroscopy.

Suggest structure prompt structure and content. In addition to any suggestions you may have, also include the following:
- Template section that may instruct ChatGPT to focus on specific paper sections, report aspects;
- Structure/framework that encourages the user to provide explicit instructions to facilitate the Chain-of-Thought process;
- Instructions to extract as much quantitative and qualitative information as possible from texts, tables, all sections, supporting information
- Instructions to critically evaluate all extracted information for consistency,
