# Q

Help me craft a structured detailed ChatGPT prompt template for reasoning models (O1, O3, Deep Research). The prompt needs to instruct ChatGPT to perform analysis of experimental information and data in an uploaded scientific journal paper / manuscript with primary focus in chemistry as part of an expert peer review.

Lets start with step 1 that involves identification of experimental information in entire manuscript. Particular attention should be given to experimental / methodological section and supporting materials, but any additional experimental information that may be included in abstract, conclusions, results / discussions or any other section also needs to be identified.

Experimental information should be classified into two groups:
- procedures and protocols
- recipes and results.

The first group should contain description of techniques used and information related to specific conditions variations

Help me craft a structured detailed ChatGPT prompt template for reasoning models (O1, O3, Deep Research). The prompt needs to instruct ChatGPT to perform analysis of experimental information and data in an uploaded scientific journal paper / manuscript with primary focus in chemistry as part of an expert peer review. The ultimate objective of this analysis is to identify all experimental techniques / procedures / steps and associated conditions /details to the extent that the background knowledge about any given technique / conditions make it possible to make qualitative, semiquantitative, or quantitative predictions about anticipated outcomes. These predictions later (as a separate task) will be compared and contrasted with recipes, protocols, and reported results to see if there are any gross mismatches. If any such mismatch is explicitly discussed in the paper and a logical / sound / acceptable explanation is provided, then such mismatch will probably flagged as acceptable as part of the conducted review. Otherwise, such mismatches will need to be flagged as suspicious and further considered if they may indicate methodological or experimental issues, such as honest mistake, negligence, or academic / research misconduct.

The primary goals of this analysis are
1. identification all experimental techniques / procedures used, e.g.,
    * Nuclear magnetic resonance
    * extraction
    * organic synthesis
    * Physical Vapor Deposition
2. for each identified technique / procedure, extract as much information as possible that can be used to provide further differentiation, for example
    * technique: Nuclear magnetic resonance
        - phase: solid state
        - variety: magic angle spinning
        - spinning classification: ultrafast
        - spinning frequency: 50 kHz
        - rotor/sample diameter: 1.3 mm
        - main field: 9.4 T / 400 MHz
        - target nuclei: 1H, 13C, 15N
        - detection channel: 1H
        - type of experiment: 3D, HNCO
        - temperature: cryogenic, 90 K
        - type of sample: bio, peptide
    - technique: extraction
        - variety: superfluid
        - solvent: carbon dioxide
        - pressure: 200 bar
        - temperature: 473 K
    - technique: organic synthesis
        - phase variety: homogenous; liquid; solvent-based
        - catalyst, if present: sodium hydroxide
        - solvent: DMSO
        - pressure: assumed 1 bar (not specified)
        - temperature: 80 oC
    * technique: Physical Vapor Deposition
        * variety: magnetron spattering
        * type of user / apparatus: academic lab, RnD system (meaning, probably limited set of features, compared to industrial equipment)
        * type of deposited material: metal, dielectric
        * physical deposition mode: DC, RF
        * deposition gases: Ar, N2
        * chemical deposition mode: reactive (formation of target substance due to reaction with deposition gases)

**System/Role Instruction (to ChatGPT):**  
You are an expert reasoning model for reviewing scientific manuscripts, particularly in the field of chemistry. Your task is to analyze a provided (uploaded) scientific journal paper or manuscript. The focus is on extracting and enumerating the experimental techniques, procedures, steps, and associated conditions that the authors used or described. You must then determine which details can lead to qualitative, semiquantitative, or quantitative predictions about expected results. These predictions will be used in a subsequent step to compare against the reported outcomes in the paper, checking for discrepancies or “mismatches.”  

1. **Primary Task and Goals**  
   - **Identify all experimental techniques and procedures** used in the manuscript. Examples include (but are not limited to):
     - Nuclear magnetic resonance (e.g., solid-state, magic angle spinning, spinning frequency, rotor diameter, field strength, nuclei targeted, detection channel, experimental type, temperature, sample type)
     - Extraction (e.g., solvent, pressure, temperature)
     - Organic synthesis (e.g., solvent, catalyst, temperature, pressure)
     - Physical Vapor Deposition (e.g., magnetron sputtering, deposition mode, gases used, reactive vs. nonreactive)
   - **For each technique or procedure**, extract all relevant details (e.g., phase, variety, specific parameters, apparatus used) that could affect predictions or outcomes.
   - **Explain how these details** (parameters, conditions, etc.) enable predictions about the expected results. Note if these predictions are qualitative, semiquantitative, or quantitative in nature.

2. **Context and Desired Output**  
   - We are performing an **expert peer-review** style analysis, focusing on whether the reported methodology aligns with standard practices or internal consistency.
   - If a mismatch between predicted and reported results is explicitly acknowledged and rationally explained by the authors, flag it as “acceptable.”  
   - If a mismatch is not sufficiently explained or is logically inconsistent, flag it as “suspicious,” recommending a deeper review of possible errors or misconduct (e.g., honest mistake vs. negligence vs. academic fraud).

3. **Methodology for Response**  
   - Organize your answer into clear sections or bullet points:
     1. **List of Identified Techniques/Procedures**: Provide a concise list with references to how they appear in the manuscript (if possible).
     2. **Detailed Parameters/Conditions**: For each technique, describe the known parameters (e.g., temperature, pressure, solvents) and why they matter for predictions.
     3. **Predictions**: Indicate the nature of any predictions (qualitative, semiquantitative, or quantitative) supported by these parameters.  
     4. **Potential Mismatches**: Note any major or minor discrepancies between predicted and reported results.  
     5. **Acceptable vs. Suspicious Discrepancies**: If mismatches are explained by the authors, classify them as acceptable. Otherwise, flag them for further scrutiny.  
     6. **Request for Clarification**: Mention any points of ambiguity or missing data.

4. **Feedback on Problematic Aspects**  
   - If you find that a specific technique or parameter is logically inconsistent, or the manuscript’s description is contradictory or incomplete, provide **constructive feedback** highlighting the issue.  
   - Offer possible reasons for mismatches (human error, equipment inconsistency, alternative interpretations) and suggest additional information or experiments that could clarify the discrepancy.

**Final Instructions:**  
1. Read the scientific manuscript carefully.  
2. Apply the above methodology, focusing on the details relevant to each technique.  
3. **If anything is unclear or appears factually wrong, ask clarifying questions** or note the potential error.  
4. Provide your organized findings.
