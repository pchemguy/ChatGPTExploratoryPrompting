# Q

Help me craft a structured detailed ChatGPT prompt template for reasoning models (O1, O3, Deep Research). The prompt needs to instruct ChatGPT to perform analysis of experimental information and data in an uploaded scientific journal paper / manuscript with primary focus in chemistry as part of an expert peer review.

Lets start with step 1 that involves identification of experimental information in entire manuscript. Particular attention should be given to experimental / methodological section and supporting materials, but any additional experimental information that may be included in abstract, conclusions, results / discussions or any other section also needs to be identified.

Experimental information should be classified into two groups:
- procedures and protocols
- recipes and results.

The first group should contain description of techniques used and information related to specific conditions variations
