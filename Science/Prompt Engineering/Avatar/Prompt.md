## Gemini Prompt: Professional Chemist Avatar

**Objective:** Generate a high-quality, professional-looking avatar suitable for representing a chemist or scientist. The avatar should be intelligent, approachable, and have a modern, clean aesthetic.

**Style:** 3D, emoji-style, clean lines, smooth shading, slightly stylized realism. Similar to modern mobile OS avatar styles.

**Subject:** Head and shoulders shot of a male-presenting individual.

**Key Features:**

1. **Facial Structure & Skin Tone:**
    - **Head Shape:** Oval, well-proportioned.
    - **Skin Tone:** Based on the provided image, the individual appears to have a medium-to-dark brown skin tone with warm undertones. Smooth, clear complexion.
    - **Age Appearance:** Mature adult, likely 50s-60s, conveying experience and wisdom.
    - **Expression:** Gentle, friendly smile. Approachable and intelligent. Eyes should also convey warmth and focus.
2. **Hair:**
    - **Style:** Short, neatly combed, classic men's haircut, possibly with a slight side part or brushed back.
    - **Color:** Predominantly silver or light gray, with some darker undertones (salt-and-pepper if a younger end of the age range, or mostly silver/white if older).
    - **Texture:** Smooth, well-defined strands.
3. **Eyes:**
    - **Color:** Warm brown or hazel.
    - **Details:** Clear, bright, with subtle light reflection to give them life. Defined eyelids and subtle laugh lines around the eyes appropriate for the age.
    - **Eyebrows:** Neatly shaped, matching the hair color (silver/gray), medium thickness.
4. **Nose & Mouth:**
    - **Nose:** Proportionate to the face, not overly prominent.
    - **Mouth:** Closed-mouth smile, or a slight smile showing a hint of teeth. Lips should be a natural color.
5. **Attire & Accessories:**
    - **Primary Clothing:** A crisp, white lab coat, open at the front. The lapels should be visible.
    - **Underneath Coat:** A collared shirt, perhaps in a shade like muted blue, gray, or the original teal/light turquoise, visible at the neckline.
    - **Professional Accessory:**
        - **Option 1 (Subtle):** A pen or a couple of pens neatly placed in the breast pocket of the lab coat.
        - **Option 2 (More distinct):** Safety goggles. These could be worn conventionally, pushed up onto the forehead, or perhaps even held in one hand if the framing allowed (though for a head and shoulders shot, on the head or around the neck might be better). The goggles should look modern and functional.
        - **(Consider avoiding holding glassware like beakers/flasks for a headshot to keep it clean, unless specifically desired for a more active "in the lab" feel).**
    - **Eyeglasses:** Modern, thin-rimmed eyeglasses. Frame color could be dark gray, silver, or black. Lenses should be clear (no tint).

**Artistic Details & Lighting:**
- **Lighting:** Soft, even lighting, as if from the front or slightly above. Avoid harsh shadows. Subtle highlights to define features.
- **Background:** Transparent background OR a very simple, neutral, out-of-focus background (e.g., a soft gray, light blue, or a subtly textured scientific/lab-like pattern if not distracting). The focus should be entirely on the avatar.
- **Perspective:** Front-facing, slight three-quarter view is acceptable.
- **Overall Mood:** Professional, intelligent, innovative, approachable, modern.

**Negative Prompts (Things to Avoid):**
- Cartoonish or overly exaggerated features.
- Messy or unkempt appearance.
- Dark or moody lighting.
- Busy or distracting backgrounds (e.g., overly complex lab equipment unless specifically requested and well-integrated).
- Outdated or overly casual attire.
- Unrealistic proportions.
- Silly or mad scientist tropes (unless that's the specific intent, which it isn't here).

**Output Format:** High-resolution PNG with a transparent background if possible.

**Example Keywords for AI:** `3D avatar, chemist, scientist, mature man, silver hair, glasses, lab coat, safety goggles (optional), professional headshot, clean design, emoji style, intelligent expression.`

## Gemini Prompt: Professional Chemist Avatar - Prioritizing Facial Recognizability

**Overall Goal:** Generate a 3D emoji-style avatar of a professional chemist. **CRITICAL LIKENESS REQUIREMENT:** If a reference photograph of a person is provided, the **ABSOLUTE PRIORITY** is that the avatar's face (including face shape, eye shape and placement, nose, mouth, and unique facial characteristics) **MUST BE CLEARLY AND UNMISTAKABLY RECOGNIZABLE** as the person in that photograph. **Stylistic Application:** Once facial recognizability is achieved, this recognizable face should then be rendered in the 3D emoji style and incorporate the other specified characteristics (age appearance, hair, attire, etc.) as described below. The originally uploaded avatar (WM5XRr6yrWIYuNGxXQ8_o.png) serves as a key visual reference for the _overall desired artistic style, clothing, and general character type_.

**Style (Inspired by original reference WM5XRr6yrWIYuNGxXQ8_o.png):**
- 3D, emoji-style, clean lines, smooth shading, slightly stylized realism.
- The final output should aesthetically align with modern mobile OS avatar styles, similar to the provided reference image.

**Subject:** Head and shoulders shot of a male-presenting individual.

**Reference Photo Integration - Detailed Instructions for Facial Features:**
1. **Foundation is Likeness:** The avatar’s entire facial structure—overall face shape, forehead, cheeks, jawline, chin, eye shape and color, eyebrow shape, nose shape, mouth shape, and lip form—must be directly derived from and be highly recognizable as the person in the **provided reference photograph.**
2. **Unique Features:** Pay close attention to any unique but subtle facial landmarks in the reference photo (e.g., specific moles if prominent and desired, distinct dimples, unique eyebrow arch) and incorporate them to enhance recognizability, ensuring they fit the clean emoji style.
3. **Expression:** Aim for a gentle, friendly, and intelligent smile, as seen in the original reference avatar, adapted naturally to the features of the person in the photo. The eyes should convey warmth and focus.

**Application of Other Characteristics (to the recognizable face):**
1. **Age Appearance:** The recognizable face should be depicted as a mature adult, likely in their 50s-60s, conveying experience and wisdom. This may involve subtly aging the features from the reference photo if the person in the photo is younger, while maintaining recognizability.
2. **Skin Tone:** The individual in the original reference avatar (WM5XRr6yrWIYuNGxXQ8_o.png) has a medium-to-dark brown skin tone with warm undertones. Apply this skin tone to the recognizable face from the photo. Ensure a smooth, clear complexion consistent with the emoji style. _If applying this exact skin tone severely compromises recognizability of the person in the photo (e.g., if the photo shows a person with a very different natural skin tone), prioritize recognizability and adjust the avatar's skin tone to be a closer, natural-looking match to the photo, while still aiming for a warm and professional feel._
3. **Hair (Styled on the recognizable head):**
    - **Style:** Short, neatly combed, classic men's haircut, possibly with a slight side part or brushed back, similar to the original reference avatar.
    - **Color:** Predominantly silver or light gray, with some darker undertones (salt-and-pepper or mostly silver/white), as seen in the original reference avatar.
    - **Texture:** Smooth, well-defined strands.
4. **Eyeglasses (Fitted to the recognizable face):**
    - Modern, thin-rimmed eyeglasses, similar in style to the original reference avatar. Frame color could be dark gray, silver, or black. Lenses should be clear.
5. **Attire & Accessories (Consistent with original reference avatar style):**
    - **Primary Clothing:** A crisp, white lab coat, open at the front. Lapels visible.
    - **Underneath Coat:** A collared shirt, teal or light turquoise in color (as seen in the original reference avatar), visible at the neckline.
    - **Professional Accessory (Optional, choose one if desired, keep it clean):**
        - A pen or two in the breast pocket.
        - Safety goggles (modern, functional) worn on the head/forehead.

**Artistic Details & Lighting:**
- **Lighting:** Soft, even front lighting, minimal harsh shadows, similar to the original reference avatar.
- **Background:** Transparent background OR a simple, neutral, out-of-focus background.
- **Perspective:** Front-facing or slight three-quarter view.
- **Overall Mood:** Professional, knowledgeable, caring, approachable, modern, trustworthy.

**Crucial Points to Avoid:**
- **Losing Likeness:** Do NOT create a generic face. The resemblance to the reference photo's facial features is paramount.
- **Stylistic Inconsistency:** While prioritizing likeness, do not abandon the requested 3D emoji style, age, hair, and attire. It's a blend.
- Overly cartoonish or exaggerated features beyond the defined style.
- Messy appearance, dark/moody lighting, busy backgrounds.

**Output Format:** High-resolution PNG with a transparent background if possible.
