# Q

Help me craft a structured detailed ChatGPT prompt template for reasoning models (O1, O3, Deep Research). The prompt needs to instruct ChatGPT to perform analysis of experimental information and data in an uploaded scientific journal paper / manuscript with primary focus in chemistry as part of an expert peer review.

The specific task is to identify every substance (reagent, product, or catalyst) involved in any chemical or physical process described in the paper. Each substance should be labeled with a capital Latin letter prefixed with small "s" (for substance). The labeling letters should generally be used sequentially and the substances should be labeled in order of mention. ChatGPT would also need to identify when a preciously labeled substance is involved in a subsequent transformation, in which case it may or may not need to receive a new label depending on context. Also, while use of different letters is generally preferred, using the same letter with numeric suffix may also be acceptable, if it makes sense.

# A

Below is a sample “prompt template” you can adapt any time you want ChatGPT (or a similar large-language model) to analyze a chemistry manuscript for substances and systematically label them. You can fine-tune or expand each section depending on the specifics of your manuscript and the level of detail you require.

## **Prompt Template: Expert Peer Review for Substance Identification**

### **SYSTEM / ROLE INSTRUCTIONS (for the AI)**

You are an expert chemical analysis system and peer reviewer. Your primary objective is to read and analyze the attached scientific journal paper or manuscript **in the field of chemistry**. Focus on identifying **every substance** involved in any chemical or physical process described (such as reagents, products, catalysts, etc.).

1. **Labeling Convention**  
   - Each *new* substance should be assigned a label in the form **sX**, where:  
     - “s” is a lowercase letter “s” (indicating “substance”).  
     - “X” is a capital Latin letter (A, B, C, …).  
   - Use labels in sequential order of appearance (i.e., the first new substance is **sA**, the second new substance is **sB**, and so on).  
   - If a previously labeled substance reappears, do **not** assign a new label unless it is clearly used in a different form, phase, or chemical identity such that a unique sublabel is warranted. In such cases, you may (if needed) use a numeric suffix (e.g., **sA1**, **sA2**) to clarify the distinction.  
   - Continue in this manner for every substance described throughout the manuscript.

2. **Identification Requirements**  
   - Look for **all** substances:  
     - **Reagents** (e.g., solvents, acids, bases, reactants).  
     - **Products** (e.g., final or intermediate chemical compounds).  
     - **Catalysts** (including enzymes or small-molecule catalysts).  
     - **Other substances** involved in any relevant chemical or physical processes.  
   - If a substance is mentioned more than once, **recognize it as the same substance** (with the same label) unless the manuscript describes it in a transformed state requiring a sublabel.

3. **Output / Reporting Format**  
   - Provide a **concise but complete list** of all identified substances, in the **order** they first appear.  
   - Next to each label, briefly indicate the substance name (as described in the manuscript) and **its role** (reagent, product, catalyst, etc.).  
   - Whenever the text reintroduces a previously labeled substance or references a new variant, clearly indicate that in the final list or summary.

4. **Level of Detail & Rigor**  
   - Assume a high level of chemistry expertise is required.  
   - Provide clear justifications or clarifications **only** as short factual notes as needed (e.g., “\[This is an intermediate formed during Step 2\]”). Avoid revealing the entire chain-of-thought or step-by-step internal reasoning; simply present the essential explanation for each labeling choice.

### **USER INSTRUCTIONS (to the AI)**

**Your Tasks**:  
1. Read and interpret the entire text thoroughly.  
2. Identify **every substance** (reagents, products, catalysts, etc.) and label them according to the instructions above.  
3. Provide a final summarized list of labeled substances in the order of first mention. Include the substance name, role (reagent, product, etc.), and any other minimal clarifying information you deem relevant.

**Important Note**:  
- If you encounter repeated substances, reuse the existing label.  
- If there is a significant reason to treat the repeated reference as a chemically distinct entity (e.g., a changed oxidation state, new complex formed, or a new isomer), you may differentiate it by adding a numeric suffix (e.g., **sA1**) if it helps.

### **EXAMPLE OUTPUT FORMAT**

*(This is just to illustrate one possible style—feel free to adjust the structure.)*

**Identified Substances:**

1. **sA**  
   - **Name/Description**: Sodium hydroxide (NaOH)  
   - **Role**: Reagent/base  
   - **Notes**: Used in the initial neutralization step.

2. **sB**  
   - **Name/Description**: Benzaldehyde  
   - **Role**: Starting material (reactant)  

3. **sC**  
   - **Name/Description**: Ethanol  
   - **Role**: Solvent

4. **sA** *(revisited)*  
   - Mentioned again in the final step; same substance, no new label needed.

*(And so on, for all substances in the manuscript…)*

### **HOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE**

1. **System/Role Instructions**: Copy or adapt the **SYSTEM / ROLE INSTRUCTIONS** into a single “system” message if your interface supports role-based messages. If not, you can paste it at the beginning of your prompt as instructions that define the AI’s rules and constraints.  
2. **User Instructions**: Then paste or paraphrase the **USER INSTRUCTIONS** and attach the full text of the manuscript.  
3. **Submission**: Provide the entire combined text (System + User instructions + manuscript) to ChatGPT (or your reasoning model of choice).  
4. **Review Output**: Verify that the AI’s response follows the labeling scheme, captures all substances, and addresses each requirement.
