OK, satire it is (or, perhaps, you might suggest one of the more specific term, after we discuss the target).

So, imagine a hypothetical situation. There is a monstrous company (let's call it G) that develops foundation of a new cool tech (let's call it L), but the first company, that brings actual product to the market is another company (let's call it O). The company O has two monthly paid plans for general audience, $20/m called "PLUS" and $200/m called "PRO". The company G catches up and brings its own product and a paid plan "ADVANCED" for $20/m. Both companies also offer free plans. The same product may be available on multiple plans with the same name, but differing set of features, with more features or higher limits on pricier plans. Suppose, the company G has a product line called Gemini and the company rereferred to the same line on the advanced plan as, naturally, Gemini ADVANCED. Suppose, the G's top product variant, available on ALL plans is called 2.5 PRO. When used on the paid plan, the qualified name would be Gemini ADVANCED 2.5 PRO.

After some time, the company G has decided that the time is to mirror offerings of company O with its new $250/m plan "ULTRA". Well, "ADVANCED" and "ULTRA" play well as two plans intuitively indicating that ULTRA is better than ADVANCED. But apparently the catching company G wants to poke its fierce competitor and renames its $20/m plan to "PRO", which coincidentally matches the name of the $200/m "PRO" plan of company O. Note that the tech L is known for messy naming. Now, it seems that the company G has decided to make its own contribution, as having a PRO plan AND a PRO product variant available on all plans does not really help. Should I call the specific product I have been using Gemini PRO 2.5 PRO!? Sounds like another mess...

Trying to make sense of AI product tiers in 2025 has become a full-time job.

The current strategy: if your competitor has an expensive "PRO" plan, just name your affordable plan "PRO" too! What could possibly go wrong?

Anyway, I have to go use my "Gemini PRO 2.5 PRO" now. Wish me luck.

P.S. This post is also a small AI experiment.

The images and text were created through a collaborative process with AI. Hereâ€™s the workflow:

1. I configured Gemini as an AI assistant using my custom "Adaptive Prompt Engineering Assistant & Tutor" prompt (from Appendix B of my recent preprint: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03332).
2. I described the chaotic branding situation and had the AI assistant generate a detailed prompt for a satirical image.
3. The attached images are the results from using that single prompt in both ChatGPT and Gemini's own image generator.
4. Finally, I tasked the original AI assistant with writing this social media post.

For those interested in the prompt engineering details, you can see the entire AI conversation here: https://g.co/gemini/share/b8ad0010d379
