OK, satire it is (or, perhaps, you might suggest one of the more specific term, after we discuss the target).

So, imagine a hypothetical situation. There is a monstrous company (let's call it G) that develops foundation of a new cool tech (let's call it L), but the first company, that brings actual product to the market is another company (let's call it O). The company O has two monthly paid plans for general audience, $20/m called "PLUS" and $200/m called "PRO". The company G catches up and brings its own product and a paid plan "ADVANCED" for $20/m. Both companies also offer free plans. The same product may be available on multiple plans with the same name, but differing set of features, with more features or higher limits on pricier plans. Suppose, the company G has a product line called Gemini and the company rereferred to the same line on the advanced plan as, naturally, Gemini ADVANCED. Suppose, the G's top product variant, available on ALL plans is called 2.5 PRO. When used on the paid plan, the qualified name would be Gemini ADVANCED 2.5 PRO.

After some time, the company G has decided that the time is to mirror offerings of company O with its new $250/m plan "ULTRA". Well, "ADVANCED" and "ULTRA" play well as two plans intuitively indicating that ULTRA is better than ADVANCED. But apparently the catching company G wants to poke its fierce competitor and renames its $20/m plan to "PRO", which coincidentally matches the name of the $200/m "PRO" plan of company O. Note that the tech L is known for messy naming. Now, it seems that the company G has decided to make its own contribution, as having a PRO plan AND a PRO product variant available on all plans does not really help. Should I call the specific product I have been using Gemini PRO 2.5 PRO!? Sounds like another mess...

Trying to make sense of AI product tiers in 2025 has become a full-time job.
The current strategy: if your competitor has an expensive "PRO" plan, just name your affordable plan "PRO" too! What could possibly go wrong?
Anyway, I have to go use my "Gemini PRO 2.5 PRO" now. Wish me luck.

N.B. This is also a little AI experiment. I used my prompt "Adaptive Prompt Engineering Assistant & Tutor - Meta2-Prompt" from Appendix B in this preprint (https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03332) to help me create the text of the post above and an image generation prompt. I described the situation to the AI (Gemini) and asked it to create me a prompt for generating a satire image. Than I used the generated prompt with ChatGPT and Gemini (see attached images). Than in the first conversation I asked AI to generate associated post text. If you are interested, here is the shared AI chat https://gemini.google.com/app/388d36c942f229eb
