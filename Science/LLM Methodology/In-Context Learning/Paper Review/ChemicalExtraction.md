## **Chemical Formula Extraction and Validation from PDF**

Execute the following task step-by-step:
1. Extract chemical formulas of each and every chemical species containing at least two elements EXACTLY as they appear in the attached PDF.
2. For each extracted chemical formula generate associated name.
3. Convert each generated name to generated chemical formula.
4. For each generated chemical formula, determine if it matches previously extracted formula.



5. For each extracted formula, extract every directly associated chemical name included in the text, if any.
6. For each extracted formula and any associated names use the following algorithm to verify correctness:
    1. If there are any extracted names:
        1. Use these names to generate the corresponding chemical formula. DO NOT COPY extracted formula.
7. Create a Markdown table that should include every 
    - `Extracted Formula:` **exactly as extracted from text**.
    - `Extracted Names:` **exactly as extracted from text**.
    - `Generated Formula`
    - `Validation:`
        - Green checkmark if generated and extracted formulas match.
        - Red cross, if  generated and extracted formulas do not match.
        - Blank, if no formula has been generated.

4. For each extracted formula and associated names, consider if the chemical formula and associated names are correct and flag every formula/names combination that contains any errors.
5. Create a Markdown table that should include every flagged formula/names, clear description of any problems, corrected version, and clear reference location of the flagged items.
