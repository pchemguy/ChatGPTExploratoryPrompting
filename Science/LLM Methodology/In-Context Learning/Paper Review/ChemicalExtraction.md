## **Chemical Formula Extraction and Validation from PDF**

Execute the following task step-by-step:
1. Extract each and every chemical formula from the attached PDF.
2. For each extracted formula, extract every directly associated chemical name included in the text, if any.
3. For each extracted formula and associated names, consider if the chemical formula and associated names are correct and flag every formula/names combination that contains any errors.
4. For each flagged item, read the source PDF again and confirm that the item was extracted exactly. In case of any extraction errors, analyze the corrected item and consider if the flag should be removed.
5. Created a Markdown table that should included every flagged formula/names, clear description of any problems, corrected version, and clear reference location of the flagged items.
