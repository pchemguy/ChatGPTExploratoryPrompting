Okay, I will now perform the critical analysis of the core experimental protocol of the provided manuscript (Prasad et al., Anal. Chem. 2011) and its Supporting Information (SI), following the instructions in Section D.

**CRITICAL REMINDER:** This analysis evaluates the *methods* based on established scientific principles and standard practices *a priori*, independent of the results reported by the authors. The feasibility and appropriateness of the protocol are judged solely on the description provided, adhering to the **Principle of Independent Methodological Scrutiny (Section A.2)**.

## **D. Experimental Protocol Analysis**

### **D.1. General Protocol Overview and Assessment**

1.  **Overall Summary & Logical Flow:**
    *   **Key Stages:**
        1.  **Enrichment of H217O/H218O from Tap Water:**
            *   Stage 1a: Slow evaporation of tap water (~1-2 L down to 20-50 mL) in a shallow black bowl on a windowsill.
            *   Stage 1b: Brief boiling (microwave, 30s) of collected water ("sterilization").
            *   Stage 1c: Fractional distillation of accumulated, evaporated water (~500 mL) using a packed column setup (Figure S1). Fractions collected based on boiling point.
        2.  **Characterization of Enriched Water:** Density, refractive index, 17O NMR, 1H NMR.
        3.  **Preparation of 17O-labeled Compounds:**
            *   NaOH/Na17OH (from Na + H217O).
            *   H217O2 (electrolysis of H217O).
            *   17O-1-Hexanol (SN2 reaction of iodohexane with Na17OH).
            *   17O-Trimethylsilanol & 17O-Hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDS) (hydrolysis of BSTFA with H217O).
            *   17O-Camphor (exchange reaction with H217O).
        4.  **Characterization of Labeled Compounds:** 17O, 1H, 13C NMR; GC-MS (including fragmentation and retention time analysis).
        5.  **Quantification of Enrichment:** Primarily via GC-MS analysis of 17O-1-Hexanol and 17O-HMDS derivatives (comparing isotopologue ratios to unlabeled standards). Also inferred from 1H NMR shift of water in CDCl3.
        6.  **Mechanistic Investigation:** Study of oxygen exchange between camphor/cyclohexanone and primary alcohols (ethanol, hexanol) using 17O NMR and GC-MS.
    *   **Core Stages for Main Result:** The central claim revolves around the enrichment process. Therefore, the core stages producing the main result are **1a (Slow Evaporation)** and **1c (Fractional Distillation)**.
    *   **Logical Flow Assessment:** The overall flow (enrichment -> characterization/use -> quantification) is logical. However, the "sterilization" step (1b) by brief microwaving seems insufficient and poorly justified for eliminating potential microbial contamination accumulated during slow, open-air evaporation. The synthesis steps appear standard for the targets. The mechanistic study arises opportunistically from the camphor labeling.
    *   **Completeness Evaluation:**
        *   *Enrichment (Stage 1a):* Lacks critical details: Ambient temperature/humidity ranges, typical evaporation times, specific dimensions of the "shallow black bowl", control over air flow/dust ingress, justification for the "black bowl" (presumably for solar heating, but uncontrolled).
        *   *Distillation (Stage 1c):* Lacks: Column dimensions (length, diameter), precise nature/amount/packing density of glass wool, quantification of heat input (Variac "setting 50" is not standardized), actual boil-up rate, reflux ratio control (none described, likely relies on passive reflux), system pressure monitoring/control (ambient pressure assumed, but fluctuations affect boiling points), degree of insulation. Details for thermometer calibration/accuracy are missing (uncorrected temperatures reported).
        *   *Syntheses:* Generally appear standard, though stoichiometry for Na + H2O (Scheme 1) seems reversed or ambiguously described (implies 0.13 mmol Na reacts with 0.2 mmol H2O, leaving excess water, but states "when the metal had all reacted"). Electrolysis details (current density, electrode surface area, spacing) are minimal.
        *   *Characterization/Quantification:* GC-MS methods seem reasonably detailed (column, temps). NMR acquisition parameters are provided. Density/RI methods are standard but lack uncertainty propagation details. H2O2 quantitation assays are standard.

2.  **Contextual Appropriateness (Stage of Research):**
    *   The work presents itself as developing an "inexpensive method" for H217O enrichment and demonstrating its use. The enrichment part appears highly exploratory and closer to a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) than a validated, reproducible method. The lack of control and detailed characterization of the enrichment process itself aligns with PoC.
    *   The subsequent syntheses and characterizations appear more like standard application/demonstration examples.
    *   The rigor of the enrichment protocol description is very low, even for PoC. Key parameters influencing isotope separation (temperature, pressure, reflux, column efficiency) are either uncontrolled or poorly documented. This significantly undermines the reliability and reproducibility of the core claim (achieving ~90% enrichment).

3.  **Identification of General Red Flags:**
    *   **Questionable Equipment/Methods:**
        *   *Windowsill Evaporation:* Highly uncontrolled, subject to environmental variations (temp, humidity, airflow, sunlight) and contamination (dust, microbes). Not a standard/reliable method for quantitative enrichment aiming for high levels.
        *   *Microwave Boiling for Sterilization:* 30 seconds of boiling is unlikely to guarantee sterility, especially if spores are present. Its relevance is questionable.
        *   *Fractional Distillation Setup:* Glass wool packing provides very low efficiency (low theoretical plates) compared to standard packings (e.g., Raschig rings, structured packing) or Vigreux columns. Lack of active reflux control and reliance on a Variac for heating provides poor stability. Insulation appears minimal (foil in photo S1, none mentioned in text). Thermometer placement seems standard, but calibration is crucial and unmentioned.
    *   **Unconventional Procedures:** The open-air, uncontrolled evaporation step is highly unconventional for isotope enrichment requiring quantitative control.
    *   **Data Handling:** Calculation of enrichment from GC-MS seems plausible (correcting for natural abundance), but relies on assumptions about fragmentation consistency between isotopologues. Using 1H NMR shift difference in CDCl3 (Figure 6b) as a quantitative measure seems highly questionable without rigorous calibration across a wide range and validation against a primary method; it's prone to solvent effects, concentration dependencies, and potential exchange issues not fully explored. Density/RI changes are reported but lack robust correlation to enrichment level.
    *   **Safety:** No specific safety precautions are mentioned for handling sodium metal, iodohexane, BSTFA, or operating the distillation/electrolysis setups.

4.  **General Critique and Alternatives Framework (Focus on Enrichment):**
    *   **Issue 1: Uncontrolled Evaporation:**
        *   **Impact:** Extremely poor reproducibility expected. Enrichment efficiency will vary wildly with weather/season. High risk of contamination invalidating results or interfering with subsequent steps. Efficiency likely low due to non-equilibrium conditions.
        *   **Author's Justification:** Implied: cost-saving ("inexpensive method").
        *   **Potential Counter-Arguments:** Acceptable for initial PoC *if* acknowledged as uncontrolled and *if* subsequent steps rigorously validated the actual enrichment achieved.
        *   **Superior Alternatives:** Controlled evaporation under reduced pressure with defined temperature and surface area. Multi-stage flash distillation. Membrane separation (pervaporation). (Sources: Standard chemical engineering texts on separation processes; specialized literature on water isotope separation, e.g., Van Hook, J. Phys. Chem. 1968, 72, 1234-1244 on VPIE).
    *   **Issue 2: Low-Efficiency Fractional Distillation:**
        *   **Impact:** The setup (glass wool packing, likely short column based on Fig S1 visual estimate, poor heat control/insulation) will have very few theoretical plates. Separating isotopes with small volatility differences (like H217O/H216O) requires high efficiency columns (many theoretical plates) and careful control of reflux ratio and boil-up rate. Achieving ~90% enrichment via this setup seems *a priori* highly improbable.
        *   **Author's Justification:** Implied: simplicity, cost.
        *   **Potential Counter-Arguments:** Perhaps sufficient for *some* enrichment, but claiming ~90% stretches credibility based on the described apparatus.
        *   **Superior Alternatives:** Longer column, efficient packing (e.g., structured packing like Sulzer DX, Goodloe), Vigreux column, spinning band distillation column. Precise temperature control (thermostatic mantle), active reflux control (timer/solenoid head), vacuum operation (to enhance relative volatility), proper insulation. (Sources: Standard organic chemistry lab manuals, e.g., Zubrick, "The Organic Chem Lab Survival Manual"; Chemical engineering texts on distillation, e.g., Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook).

### **D.2. In-Depth Analysis of the Core Experimental Protocol (Implementation of the Main Result)**

**PREREQUISITE D.1 COMPLETED.** Findings from D.1 (low rigor, poor control, questionable equipment) are integrated below.

1.  **Stated Main Result (Link to Section B.1):**
    *   **Restatement:** Enrichment of H217O from natural abundance (0.04%) in tap water to ~90% (quantitative claim from abstract, page 1) or 99.7% (quantitative claim from Table 1, page 4, for fraction #11, although footnote c implies this is % 17O, contradicting the abstract's ~90% H217O claim – likely a typo or confusion between atom % O and mol % H217O, needs clarification, but I will use ~90% H217O as the primary claim based on abstract/intro emphasis). **[Inconsistency Noted]**
    *   **Unmet Need:** Prohibitively high cost of commercially available H217O.
    *   **Novelty:** Claimed inexpensive method combining slow evaporation and fractional distillation of tap water.

2.  **Listing of Core Stages:**
    *   **Stage A:** Slow Evaporation and Collection (Page 2, "Enrichment of H217O from Tap Water")
    *   **Stage B:** Fractional Distillation (Page 2, "Fractional Distillation of the Enriched Water")

3.  **Analysis of Core Stages:**

    *   **Stage A. Slow Evaporation and Collection**
        *   **A. Stage Description & Procedure:** Tap water (1-2 L) placed in a shallow black bowl, left on a windowsill to evaporate at room temperature until volume reduced to 20-50 mL. Collected water briefly boiled in a microwave (30s, high power). Process repeated to accumulate >1 L of pre-enriched water. Equipment: Shallow black bowl (material/size unspecified), measuring cup, microwave oven.
        *   **B. Reported Metrics & Intermediate Values:** Initial volume: 1-2 L. Final volume per batch: 20-50 mL (implies 40-50x volume reduction). Accumulated volume: >1 L. Microwave time: 30 s. **No intermediate enrichment level reported for this stage.** Crucial missing data: evaporation time, ambient conditions (T, H), precise dimensions.
        *   **C. Associated Figure Analysis:** No figure directly illustrates this stage.
        *   **D. Equipment/Process - Critical Performance Analysis:**
            1.  *Critical Characteristics:*
                *   *Selective Evaporation:* Relies on the Vapor Pressure Isotope Effect (VPIE), where H216O has a slightly higher vapor pressure than H217O and H218O, leading to enrichment of heavier isotopes in the remaining liquid. Efficiency depends on maintaining conditions close to equilibrium (slow evaporation helps) and preventing complete drying.
                *   *Temperature/Humidity:* Strongly influence evaporation rate and potentially VPIE magnitude. Uncontrolled.
                *   *Surface Area/Volume Ratio:* Affects evaporation rate. Bowl geometry unspecified.
                *   *Air Flow:* Affects rate and deviation from equilibrium. Uncontrolled.
                *   *Contamination Control:* Open bowl on windowsill is highly susceptible to dust, pollen, microbes, chemical vapors, rainwater ingress. Microwave boiling is inadequate sterilization.
            2.  *Assess Adequacy & Gauge Missing Values:* The process lacks any control over critical parameters. Adequacy for achieving *significant, reproducible* enrichment is extremely low. Gauged values: Assume standard room temp (20-25°C), humidity (variable 40-80% RH). Evaporation time likely days to weeks depending on conditions and volume. Bowl diameter could be 20-40 cm?
        *   **E. A Priori Feasibility Assessment (Stage-Level):** Slow evaporation *can* theoretically enrich heavy water isotopes due to VPIE. However, the degree of enrichment achievable in an open, uncontrolled system is highly questionable and certainly not predictable or reproducible. A 40-50x volume reduction is extreme and risks concentrating non-volatile impurities from tap water significantly. Contamination risk is severe. The brief microwave boiling step adds little value. Feasibility for producing a *clean, significantly and reproducibly enriched* starting material for distillation is very low.
        *   **F. Idealized Model Performance Estimation (Stage-Level):**
            1.  *Principle & Model:* Vapor Pressure Isotope Effect (VPIE). Model: Rayleigh distillation equation for batch evaporation: R/R₀ = (V/V₀)^(α-1), where R is the isotope ratio (¹⁷O/¹⁶O), V is volume, and α is the separation factor (P₁₆/P₁₇, vapor pressures).
            2.  *Parameter Identification:* Separation factor α for H₂¹⁷O/H₂¹⁶O. Literature values vary slightly with temperature, but α ≈ 1.008 - 1.01 at room temperature (e.g., based on data in Jancso & Van Hook, Chem. Rev. 1974, 74, 689-750). Let's use α = 1.008 (conservative). Initial ratio R₀ ≈ 0.00037 (natural abundance ¹⁷O). Volume ratio V/V₀ = 1/40 (average reduction).
            3.  *Calculation:* R/R₀ = (1/40)^(1.008-1) = (0.025)^0.008. ln(R/R₀) = 0.008 * ln(0.025) = 0.008 * (-3.689) ≈ -0.0295. R/R₀ ≈ exp(-0.0295) ≈ 0.971. This calculation suggests the ¹⁷O/¹⁶O ratio *decreases* slightly (becomes depleted) in the liquid under ideal equilibrium evaporation, which contradicts the expected enrichment. **Recheck Model/Assumption:** Rayleigh equation applies to the *vapor* composition relative to initial liquid, or liquid composition during *condensation*. For *evaporation*, the liquid becomes enriched in the less volatile component. The correct Rayleigh form for liquid enrichment is R/R₀ = (V/V₀)^(1/α - 1). Let's recalculate: R/R₀ = (1/40)^(1/1.008 - 1) ≈ (0.025)^(-0.0079) ≈ 1.0297. The final ¹⁷O ratio R would be ~1.03 * R₀ = 1.03 * 0.00037 ≈ 0.00038. This predicts only ~3% increase in the ¹⁷O ratio (from 0.037% to 0.038%) under *ideal equilibrium* conditions for a 40x volume reduction.
            4.  *Comparison & Feasibility Assessment:* The idealized calculation suggests minimal enrichment (~3% relative increase, reaching perhaps 0.038 atom % ¹⁷O) even under perfect equilibrium. Achieving the necessary level to feed the distillation stage (which supposedly reaches ~90%) seems impossible via this method alone. The actual non-equilibrium, uncontrolled process would likely perform worse. This stage appears fundamentally incapable of providing significant pre-enrichment.

    *   **Stage B. Fractional Distillation**
        *   **A. Stage Description & Procedure:** ~500 mL of pre-enriched water placed in 1 L RBF. Setup: Vertical condenser packed with glass wool (uncooled), topped with tilted condenser (water-cooled), single-neck still head for fraction collection. Heated with mantle + Variac (setting 50). Boiling point monitored at top of vertical condenser. Fractions collected: 6 x 10 mL at 98.5°C, 1 x 10 mL at 99°C (uncorrected temps, reference tap water BP = 97°C at 370m altitude). Equipment: 1L RBF, 2 condensers (type/size unspecified), still head, heating mantle, Variac, thermometer, glass wool.
        *   **B. Reported Metrics & Intermediate Values:** Starting volume: ~500 mL. Fraction volumes/BPs: 60 mL @ 98.5°C, 10 mL @ 99°C. Residue volume ~100 mL (Table 1). Variac setting 50. Reference BP 97°C. **Final quantitative claim: ~90% H217O in 99°C fraction (Abstract), 99.7% 17O in 99°C fraction (Table 1, footnote c).** [Inconsistency noted again]. Table 1 also reports isotope percentages for fraction #5 (98.5°C BP): 0.2% 16O, 99.1% 17O, 0.7% 18O. And residue: 13.0% 16O, 29.7% 17O, 57.3% 18O.
        *   **C. Associated Figure Analysis (Figure S1):**
            1.  *Overall:* Schematic (left) and Photo (right) illustrating the fractional distillation setup. Purpose: Show apparatus construction.
            2.  *Detailed Description:*
                *   *Schematic:* Shows RBF, packed column (vertical condenser body?), still head with thermometer, Liebig (?) condenser (tilted, cooled), collection flask. Packing indicated by wavy lines ("glass wool").
                *   *Photo:* Shows similar setup assembled. RBF in heating mantle, vertical condenser wrapped in aluminum foil (insulation, not mentioned in text), still head, tilted condenser with hoses, collection flask (appears to be another RBF). Clamping seems adequate. Components appear to be standard lab glassware. No brands visible.
            3.  *Estimation and Inference:*
                *   *Scale:* The RBF is 1L. Assuming standard dimensions (~130mm diameter), the packed vertical condenser appears to be roughly 2-2.5x the RBF diameter in length, estimating **Packed Length ≈ 25-35 cm**. Diameter looks like a standard condenser, maybe **Inner Diameter ≈ 2-3 cm**. The thermometer bulb placement appears correct (below sidearm). Foil insulation is present but likely not high performance. Glass wool packing density is unknown, but visually likely loose.
                *   *Assumptions:* Standard glassware proportions. Foil is the only insulation. Packing is loose glass wool.
            4.  *Practical Implications & Critical Assessment:* The schematic is generic. The photo confirms a simple setup. The estimated column dimensions are relatively short for difficult separations. Glass wool is a very poor packing material for fractional distillation (low surface area, channeling likely), yielding very few theoretical plates (maybe N=1-3 at best?). Foil insulation is minimal. Lack of active reflux control and reliance on Variac suggest poor stability and low efficiency. Setup is consistent with text description but appears fundamentally inadequate for achieving high isotopic enrichment of water.
        *   **D. Equipment/Process - Critical Performance Analysis:**
            1.  *Critical Characteristics:*
                *   *Column Efficiency (HETP/N):* Number of theoretical plates (N) determines separation power. Glass wool packing provides extremely high HETP (Height Equivalent to a Theoretical Plate), thus very low N for the estimated length. Critical for separating species with low relative volatility.
                *   *Relative Volatility (α):* Intrinsic property. α(H₂¹⁶O/H₂¹⁷O) ≈ 1.003-1.005 at ~100°C (derived from VPIE data, e.g., Szapiro & Steckel, Trans. Faraday Soc. 1967, 63, 883-894). This small difference requires high N.
                *   *Reflux Ratio (R):* Higher R generally improves separation but reduces throughput. No control mechanism described; likely relies on passive reflux and heat balance, highly unstable.
                *   *Heat Input / Boil-up Rate:* Must be stable and not excessive (to avoid flooding/loss of efficiency). Variac control is crude.
                *   *Insulation:* Minimizes heat loss, maintains equilibrium. Foil is poor.
                *   *Pressure Stability:* Affects boiling points and α. Ambient pressure assumed, subject to fluctuations.
            2.  *Assess Adequacy & Gauge Missing Values:* Adequacy is extremely low. N is likely << 5 (perhaps 1-3). Reflux ratio unknown and uncontrolled. Heat input unstable. Insulation poor. Pressure unstable. Missing: N/HETP value, R, boil-up rate, precise dimensions, pressure.
        *   **E. A Priori Feasibility Assessment (Stage-Level):** Given the extremely low expected efficiency (N≈1-3) of the described column (short, glass wool packed) and the very small relative volatility (α≈1.004), achieving significant enrichment of H217O via fractional distillation with this setup is highly improbable *a priori*. Reaching ~90% (or 99%+) enrichment from a starting material already poorly enriched (from Stage A) appears physically implausible with this apparatus. Standard lab distillation setups struggle with separations where α < 1.1 without significant length/efficiency/control.
        *   **F. Idealized Model Performance Estimation (Stage-Level):**
            1.  *Principle & Model:* Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium (VLE) isotope effect. Model: Fenske equation for minimum number of plates at total reflux (gives maximum possible separation for a given N): (y_D / x_B)_¹⁷O / (y_D / x_B)_¹⁶O = α^(N+1), where y_D is mole fraction in distillate, x_B is mole fraction in bottoms. Or simplified: enrichment per plate ~ α. Total enrichment ~ α^N.
            2.  *Parameter Identification:* α(¹⁶O/¹⁷O) ≈ 1.004. N (number of theoretical plates). Estimate N ≈ 2 from visual inspection and glass wool packing (being generous). Starting concentration (from Stage A estimate): ~0.038 atom % ¹⁷O. Target: ~90 atom % ¹⁷O (using Abstract value).
            3.  *Calculation:* Required enrichment factor = (Final Ratio / Initial Ratio) = (0.90 / 0.10) / (0.00038 / 0.99962) ≈ 9 / 0.00038 ≈ 23700. Maximum theoretical enrichment factor with N=2 plates ≈ α^(N+1) = (1.004)^(2+1) = (1.004)^3 ≈ 1.012. (Note: This is separation between top and bottom, not necessarily distillate enrichment factor). Alternatively, enrichment factor relative to feed E = y_D / x_F. For low concentrations and few plates, E ≈ α^N ≈ (1.004)^2 ≈ 1.008.
            4.  *Comparison & Feasibility Assessment:* The idealized calculation shows the setup (N≈2) can only provide a maximum theoretical enrichment factor of ~1.012 (or ~1.008 relative to feed). This is orders of magnitude lower than the required enrichment factor of ~23700 to reach 90% from the likely starting material. Even if the evaporation stage worked perfectly and yielded ~1% H217O (which it likely didn't), the required enrichment factor would still be ~ (0.9/0.1)/(0.01/0.99) ≈ 9 / 0.01 ≈ 900. The distillation setup is fundamentally incapable of achieving this *a priori*.

4.  **Overall A Priori Feasibility Assessment (Synthesizing Core Stages):**
    *   The combined protocol relies on two stages (evaporation, distillation) both characterized by poor control and low intrinsic efficiency for isotope separation based on the descriptions and fundamental principles.
    *   Stage A (Evaporation) likely provides negligible pre-enrichment under idealized conditions and is uncontrolled/unreliable in practice.
    *   Stage B (Distillation) uses a setup (glass wool packing, short column, poor control) with extremely low theoretical efficiency (N likely ≤ 3).
    *   Given the very small separation factor (α ≈ 1.004-1.008) for water isotopologues, achieving the claimed ~90% enrichment requires a highly efficient separation process (many theoretical plates, N >> 100, possibly >1000 depending on reflux) under carefully controlled conditions.
    *   **Conclusion:** Based solely on the *a priori* analysis of the described methodology, it is **highly implausible** that this protocol can achieve ~90% H217O enrichment. The combined theoretical limitations of the uncontrolled evaporation and the low-efficiency distillation setup are fundamentally inconsistent with the claimed quantitative outcome.

5.  **A Priori Plausibility Check: Claimed Impact vs. Method Apparent Nature:**
    1.  **Assess Claimed Significance & Impact:** The claim is significant: an "inexpensive" and "straightforward" method (Abstract, Conclusion) to produce highly enriched H217O (~90%), overcoming the "prohibitively expensive" nature of commercial supply. This would be highly valuable for researchers needing 17O labels. It implies a potentially disruptive alternative.
    2.  **Assess Core Protocol's Apparent Nature:** The core protocol (windowsill evaporation + simple distillation with glass wool) appears extremely simple, using basic, readily available equipment and relying on well-established physical principles (VPIE, VLE). No complex or specialized apparatus is described for the core enrichment.
    3.  **Evaluate Claimed Novelty/Insight:** No novel scientific principle or unique experimental trick is claimed or described as essential for success. The authors apply known isotope effects using very basic techniques. The novelty is solely in the *combination* and *claimed effectiveness* of these simple steps.
    4.  **Synthesize and Evaluate A Priori Plausibility:**
        *   **Comparison:** A highly significant/impactful result (cheap ~90% H217O) is claimed using an apparently very simple, accessible protocol based entirely on established principles.
        *   **Identify Potential Discrepancy:** Yes, the discrepancy exists: High impact claim vs. apparent simplicity/accessibility of method relying on known physics.
        *   **Pose Critical Question:** Is it genuinely plausible that such a simple, accessible method (windowsill evaporation + basic distillation) capable of achieving ~90% H217O enrichment – a valuable commodity – would have been overlooked by the scientific/industrial community actively involved in isotope separation for decades? It seems unlikely. Such separations typically require sophisticated, multi-stage, carefully controlled processes (e.g., large distillation columns, Girdler-Sulfide process, electrolysis cascades, laser enrichment).
        *   **Flag for Scrutiny:** **Yes, this assessment raises a significant red flag.** The mismatch between the extraordinary claim (~90% enrichment) and the rudimentary nature of the described core methodology demands *extraordinarily rigorous, unambiguous, and independently verifiable supporting evidence* in the results and discussion sections. The quantification methods used (GC-MS of derivatives, 1H NMR shifts) must be scrutinized with extreme prejudice for potential artifacts, misinterpretations, or lack of proper validation.

This concludes the *a priori* analysis of the experimental protocol based on the provided description and established scientific principles. The methodology described appears fundamentally inadequate to achieve the main claimed result.
