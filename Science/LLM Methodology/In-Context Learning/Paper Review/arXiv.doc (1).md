2.3.2 **Defining Quantitative and Multimodal Analysis**

The process of formalizing the review workflow began by reflecting on how an expert typically approaches a manuscript. Rather than reading linearly like a novel, reviewers often seek specific high-level information first to orient themselves and determine the paper's core assertions.

**Identifying Claims:** The initial step usually involves identifying the *main claimed result* and any *key supporting findings*. This information is typically sought in the title, abstract, introduction, and conclusions. Understanding precisely *what* the authors claim to have achieved is paramount before evaluating *how* they claim to have achieved it. For the *test paper* \[[82](#bookmark=id.7jh130j40dvd)\], this step meant, for example, extracting the main claim about inexpensive H217O enrichment via specific methods. This task of identifying and extracting core claims was formalized into instructions detailed in [IV.B](#bookmark=id.rctimdz1nul1) (Identifying Claimed Results and Contributions) of the [*PeerReviewPrompt*](#bookmark=id.trutxlqvbajg), including the [custom classification scheme](#bookmark=id.o9cqhz26rn2) (discussed in [2.2.4](#bookmark=id.7home02hiawn)) to help parse these claims structurally.

**Initial Methodological Assessment:** Once the core claims are understood, the focus shifts to evaluating the methodology described. A fundamental principle, emphasized throughout the [*PeerReviewPrompt*](#bookmark=id.trutxlqvbajg) (particularly in [IV.A](#bookmark=id.dl9n4k4xtwjo) and the [Persona](#bookmark=id.8sd9rdspunqz) definition), is the *independent assessment of methodology*. The validity of the experimental design, procedures, and data analysis must be judged based on scientific principles and best practices within the field, *without* relying on the claimed results as justification. This critical step involves scrutinizing the core experimental approach detailed by the authors, which corresponds to the analysis workflows initiated in [IV.D](#bookmark=id.9jqheheu6hks) (Analysis of Experimental Methodology) of the prompt. The goal at this stage is to determine if the described methods are fundamentally sound and capable, in principle, of supporting the types and magnitude of claims being made.

The first part of methodology assessment, [IV.D.1](#bookmark=id.7m4edg7cwpvh), defines high-level workflow and aims to flag issues that do not require in-depth analysis. Beyond assessing the general soundness of the methodology, a deeper critical review, particularly in experimental sciences, often involves evaluating the *quantitative feasibility* of the claims based on the described procedures (formalized in [IV.D.2.3.F](#bookmark=id.q6nkngotvwe5); also note that this section should be probably moved and executed prior to [IV.D.2.3.E](#bookmark=id.klxevct8u647), which should incorporate the results of "idealized modeling"). Simply stating that evaporation and distillation were used is insufficient; the reviewer must assess whether the *specific implementation* described could plausibly achieve the *magnitude* of the claimed result (e.g., the high isotopic enrichment reported in \[[82](#bookmark=id.7jh130j40dvd)\]). This assessment often requires comparing the reported outcomes against theoretical expectations derived from established scientific principles and is formalized in the second part, [IV.D.2](#bookmark=id.q5tlylkl068c), which defines workflows for deeper focused analysis of just the core methodology. (Note that such quantitative feasibility assessment is expected to be performed by the authors, particularly when claimed results are highly unexpected and, perhaps, flagged by the further discussed *A Priori* Plausibility Assessment, defined in [IV.D.2.5](#bookmark=id.vdfn7wg2cy7p). In fact, LLM can be asked to assess whether such an analysis is actually present, for example, as a new Red Flag Check in Section IV.D.1.3.)

The process of development of workflows for in-depth methodological analysis was based on analysis of the test case \[[82](#bookmark=id.7jh130j40dvd)\]. The formal analysis of the paper's main claim involves theoretical estimation of the performance of the described experimental setup, using basic process models for evaporation and fractional distillation. To guide the LLM to perform such an analysis, first it needs guidance to identify processes to be analyzed. Hence, the core methodology analysis, guided by Section [IV.D.2](#bookmark=id.q5tlylkl068c), begins (after referencing Section [IV.D.1](#bookmark=id.7m4edg7cwpvh) as a prerequisite) with steps directing the model towards identification of

1) The main claimed result in [IV.D.2.1](#bookmark=id.tpdpkdvy2tv5) and referenced therein [IV.B.1](#bookmark=id.t2ku7ztyg2dl).  
2) The core methodology / proposed solution associated with the main claimed result in [IV.B.1](#bookmark=id.t2ku7ztyg2dl) (this step necessitates further refinement as discussed in Section [2.2.4](#bookmark=id.7home02hiawn)).  
3) Individual experimental processes / stages to be analyzed (e.g., identifying two processes, evaporation and fractional distillation, as constituents of the *core methodology* in the *test paper*) in [IV.D.2.2](#bookmark=id.zh8w8h6rz3jh).

This preliminary block results in identification of the target processes (such as evaporation and fractional distillation in the test case), so the LLM could be directed further to perform detailed analysis of *each identified stage* following a focused multistep workflow defined in Section [IV.D.2.3](#bookmark=id.8z0pce2hf84l). To perform such a quantitative analysis designed to assess whether the specific claimed result is plausible in theory, LLM would need, on the one hand, to identify and extract the specific claimed quantitative characteristics associated with each analyzed stage (such as enrichment factor in the test case). On the other hand, LLM would need determine a suitable process model and collect all characteristics necessary for evaluating expected theoretical performance.

Section IV.D.2.3.A sets the stage for subsequent analysis by directing the model to extract preliminary stage-specific information and identify important constituents for further targeted information extraction and interpretation. While the entire manuscript is assumed to be loaded into LLM's context at the beginning of analysis, this step is likely important, as after performing this analysis, extracted and structured information also becomes a part of LLM's context and can be referred to at subsequent workflow steps directly. The specific wording used aims to be generic in a sense to cover a broad spectrum of experimental chemistry papers while still eliciting a detailed case-specific response.

Section [IV.D.2.3.B](#bookmark=id.slducuq8z4ls) subsequently directs the LLM, using generalized language, to identify and extract stage-related numeric quantities with the idea that all quantities present in the paper and necessary for subsequent theoretical modeling of the key stage process will be among those extracted. In real life, however, sources are often imperfect, and manuscripts may be missing key experimental characteristics. For this reason, this section also incorporates instructions for initial identification of missing key information. The goal for this task is twofold. On the one hand, it is essential to set the stage for subsequent handling of missing information necessary for performing theoretical process analysis in [IV.D.2.3.F](#bookmark=id.q6nkngotvwe5). On the other hand, it is important to assess the presence of explicit authors' reflection on / analysis of any missing key details and provided justifications (or lack thereof) as part of overall assessments of manuscript's completeness and quality and clear demonstration (or lack thereof) of authors' awareness about and understanding of any study limitations. (In fact, the natural fit for this goal is within the [IV.D.1.3](#bookmark=id.kxid7x1ddz6l) Identification of General Red Flags, which is another indication for the necessary structure optimization, including streamlining of Section IV.D discussed in [3.3](#bookmark=id.tepdmdfiy97k).)

Equipment, even if basic, often plays a key role in experimental chemistry. For this reason, special attention must be paid to this constituent and the associated workflow is defined in Section IV.D.2.3.D. For example, in the test case, fractionating distillation column is a key piece of equipment used in the fractional distillation stage, and either the number of equivalent theoretical plates or the height of the plate and the length of the column are among the important parameters necessary for estimating expected separation of mixture components. In fact, the *test paper* contains non whatsoever key details necessary for calculating expected separations. In such a case, the manuscript and supporting information need to be analyzed meticulously for any clues present to make best effort estimates or guesses for missing required characteristics using some kind of missing information handling protocol. The current version of the [*PeerReviewPrompt*](#bookmark=id.trutxlqvbajg) has a formalized missing information handling protocol components distributed between sections [IV.D.2.3.B](#bookmark=id.slducuq8z4ls), IV.D.2.3.C, and IV.D.2.3.D.

The Section IV.D.2.3.C directs the LLM to perform multimodal analysis of relevant figures as described in the referenced Section IV.C. The idea of this analysis was partially inspired by the *test paper*'s flaws and the associated quest for clues, in particular, the length of the improvised fractionating distillation column. The SI Fig. 1 contains a photograph of the experimental setup and appears to be not severely distorted. The photograph does not have any scale information, but it shows the distilling round bottom flask identified as 1 L flask in the text. Diameter of the flask can be either estimated using volume formula or simply by recalling the standard diameter for flasks of this volume. Then this diameter could be used as a scale gauge to estimate the length of the fractionating column. As before, specific language used was selected to expend the focus of the prompt, but also to maximize the amount of details extracted from photographs, without calling any specific detail. Among other goals, this section also attempts to have LLM extract and interpret details not present in text as a form of control that LLM truly analyzes the photograph, rather than faking it.

While Section IV.D.2.3.E calls for a qualitative feasibility assessment, Section [IV.D.2.3.F](#bookmark=id.q6nkngotvwe5) attempts to perform theoretical process analysis using the following steps encoded in the prompt:

1. **Select Appropriate Models/Equations:** Determine the relevant physical or chemical models and governing equations that describe the identified processes (e.g., Rayleigh equation for distillation, principles of evaporation kinetics).  
2. **Extract Explicit Parameters:** Gather necessary parameters for calculations that are explicitly provided in the manuscript or SI (e.g., starting material amounts, temperatures, reported efficiencies).  
3. **Address Missing Information (Parameters):** Recognize when critical parameters needed for the calculation are not provided in the text. This involves two sub-steps:

**a)** *Inferring from Visual Data (Multimodal Analysis):* For missing physical dimensions or setup details, instruct the LLM to analyze figures, diagrams, or photographs provided in the manuscript/SI. (This part should be partially performed in prior sections.)  
**b)** *Retrieving Standard Parameters:* For missing fundamental constants or material properties not specific to the setup, instruct the LLM to retrieve standard values from its knowledge base or reliable external sources (e.g., separation coefficients for H216O/H217O).

4. **Perform Calculations:** Execute the theoretical calculations using the gathered parameters and selected models.  
5. **Compare and Evaluate:** Compare the theoretically estimated outcomes with the results claimed by the authors, assessing the plausibility of the claims based on this quantitative analysis.
