#### **2.3.2 Defining Quantitative and Multimodal Analysis** _(Consider alternative title)_

The process of formalizing the review workflow began by reflecting on how an expert typically approaches a manuscript. Rather than reading linearly like a novel, reviewers often seek specific high-level information first to orient themselves and determine the paper's core assertions.

**Identifying Claims:** The initial step usually involves identifying the _main claimed result_ and any _key supporting findings_. This information is typically sought in the title, abstract, introduction, and conclusions. Understanding precisely _what_ the authors claim to have achieved is paramount before evaluating _how_ they claim to have achieved it. For the _test paper_ [1], this step meant, for example, extracting the main claim about inexpensive `$H_{2}^{17}O$` enrichment via specific methods. This task of identifying and extracting core claims was formalized into instructions detailed in **Section IV.B** (Identifying Claimed Results and Contributions) of the `PeerReviewPrompt`, including the custom classification scheme (discussed in Section 2.2.4) to help parse these claims structurally.

**Initial Methodological Assessment:** Once the core claims are understood, the focus shifts to evaluating the methodology described. A fundamental principle, emphasized throughout the `PeerReviewPrompt` (particularly in Section IV.A and the Persona definition), is the _independent assessment of methodology_. The validity of the experimental design, procedures, and data analysis must be judged based on scientific principles and best practices within the field, _without_ relying on the claimed results as justification. This critical step involves scrutinizing the core experimental approach detailed by the authors, which corresponds to the analysis workflows initiated in **Section IV.D** (Analysis of Experimental Methodology) of the prompt. The goal at this stage is to determine if the described methods are fundamentally sound and capable, in principle, of supporting the types and magnitude of claims being made.

The first part of this methodology assessment, **Section IV.D.1**, defines a high-level workflow aimed at flagging obvious issues that may not require in-depth quantitative analysis. Beyond assessing general soundness, however, a deeper critical review, particularly in experimental sciences, often involves evaluating the _quantitative feasibility_ of the claims based on the described procedures (formalized in **Section IV.D.2.3.F**). Simply stating that evaporation and distillation were used is insufficient; the reviewer must assess whether the _specific implementation_ described could plausibly achieve the _magnitude_ of the claimed result (e.g., the high isotopic enrichment reported in [1]). This assessment often requires comparing the reported outcomes against theoretical expectations derived from established scientific principles. This deeper analysis is guided by the workflows in the second part of the methodology section, **IV.D.2**, which focuses on the core methodology associated with the main claim. _(Self-correction: Removed notes about optimal section ordering and author expectations here)_.

The development of workflows for this in-depth methodological analysis (Section IV.D.2) was based on analyzing the test case [1]. Formal analysis of the paper's main claim involves theoretically estimating the performance of the described experimental setup using basic process models. To guide the LLM through such an analysis, Section IV.D.2 begins (after referencing Section IV.D.1 as a prerequisite) by directing the model to identify:

1. The main claimed result (via **Section IV.D.2.1** and referenced **Section IV.B.1**).
2. The core methodology / proposed solution associated with the main claimed result (also via **Section IV.B.1**, acknowledging the need for refinement discussed in 2.2.4).
3. The individual experimental processes/stages comprising the core methodology (e.g., evaporation and fractional distillation in the test paper) via **Section IV.D.2.2**.

This preliminary block identifies the target processes, allowing the LLM to be directed further to perform detailed analysis of _each identified stage_ following the focused multi-step workflow defined in **Section IV.D.2.3**. To perform the quantitative analysis within this workflow aimed at assessing theoretical plausibility, the LLM must identify claimed quantitative characteristics for the stage while also determining suitable process models and collecting all parameters necessary for evaluating expected performance.

**Section IV.D.2.3.A** sets the stage by directing the model to extract preliminary stage-specific information and identify important components for further targeted extraction. Adding this structured information to the LLM's context aids subsequent workflow steps. The wording aims for generality across experimental chemistry while eliciting case-specific detail.

**Section IV.D.2.3.B** subsequently directs the LLM to identify and extract stage-related numeric quantities needed for theoretical modeling, while also incorporating instructions for initial identification of missing key information. Identifying missing information is crucial both for handling subsequent theoretical analysis (Section IV.D.2.3.F) and, potentially, for assessing the manuscript's completeness and the authors' awareness of limitations. _(Self-correction: Removed note comparing placement with IV.D.1.3)_.

Equipment often plays a key role, addressed by the workflow in **Section IV.D.2.3.D**. In the test case, the fractionation column is key, but the paper lacks necessary details (e.g., theoretical plates, dimensions). When such details are missing, the prompt guides the LLM to meticulously analyze the manuscript and SI for clues. The `PeerReviewPrompt` includes a formalized missing information handling protocol distributed across sections **IV.D.2.3.B, IV.D.2.3.C, and IV.D.2.3.D**.

**Section IV.D.2.3.C** specifically directs the LLM to perform multimodal analysis of relevant figures (per Section IV.C description). This was partly inspired by the test paper's flaws, particularly the lack of dimensions for the improvised distillation column shown in SI Fig. 1. The prompt guides the LLM to attempt scale estimation by identifying reference objects (like the 1 L flask mentioned in the text) visible in the photograph. The prompt language encourages detailed visual analysis, including extracting details not present in the text as a control against superficial processing.

While Section IV.D.2.3.E calls for a qualitative feasibility assessment, **Section IV.D.2.3.F** implements the core quantitative theoretical analysis using the following encoded steps:

1. **Select Appropriate Models/Equations:** Determine relevant physical/chemical models and governing equations for the identified process.
2. **Extract Explicit Parameters:** Gather necessary parameters explicitly provided in the manuscript/SI.
3. **Address Missing Information (Parameters):** Recognize missing critical parameters, involving:
    - a) _Inferring from Visual Data (Multimodal Analysis):_ Analyze figures/diagrams/photos (leveraging prior analysis from IV.D.2.3.C).
    - b) _Retrieving Standard Parameters:_ Retrieve necessary fundamental constants or material properties (e.g., separation coefficients for `$H_{2}^{16}O$/$H_{2}^{17}O$`).
4. **Perform Calculations:** Execute theoretical calculations using gathered parameters and models.
5. **Compare and Evaluate:** Compare estimated outcomes with claimed results to assess quantitative plausibility.

**Summary & Next Steps:**

- Corrected citation [82] -> [1] and added LaTeX formatting.
- Removed the notes about potential prompt optimizations/reordering from this methodology description (recommend moving these reflections to Discussion/Future Work).
- **Main Question:** Please consider if this level of section-by-section detail is appropriate for the main manuscript body, or if you'd prefer to summarize the workflow of Section IV.D more concisely here and reference the full prompt in the SI for the exhaustive breakdown.

Let me know your thoughts on the level of detail and the removal of the optimization notes.
