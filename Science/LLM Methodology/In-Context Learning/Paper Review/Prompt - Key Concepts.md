## Meta 1

Help me generate a prompt that will be executed within a chat, which is used to revise a manuscript (so both the manuscript text and target audience are within the LLM's conversational context). The goal of this prompt is to extract key terms and concepts used within the title and abstract yielding a list to be used for subsequent categorization and or search terms generations.

## Meta 2

In addition to "manuscript's primary focus and contributions", perhaps the prompt should also specifically mention applications. Basically, someone reading this list should be able get an idea what the paper's focus/topic (probably covered by "manuscript's primary focus and contributions"), but also target application areas or features. I want to provide clues as to how the "manuscript's primary focus and contributions" might be of practical relevance to the audience. Based on my overall intent, consider how this prompt can be expanded / improved further.

## Meta 3

Actually, "search terms / categorization" context was a very real thing, but an attempt to narrow LLM's focus. Perhaps these context is unnecessary or could be replaced with something better given my intent? Also add explicit instructions to disregard any previously generated or extracted terms/keywords/concepts.

## Meta 4

Given the title "AI-Driven Scholarly Peer Review via Persistent Workflow Prompting, Meta-Prompting, and Meta-Reasoning", this prompt extracted
- Persistent Workflow Prompting (PWP)
- Meta-Prompting & Meta-Reasoning
- AI-Driven Scholarly Peer Review
I need you amend the prompt to yield more atomic terms or concepts:
- Persistent Workflow Prompting (PWP)
- Meta-Prompting
- Meta-Reasoning
- AI-Driven
- Scholarly Peer Review
You cannot use these specific terms as part of the prompt. The task must be described using generalized language, so that I could apply the final prompt broadly.

## Meta 5

Let's expand it further. In its present state, the prompt appears to do the requested task according to my need. Now I want to add a second stage. After generating the initial list, the LLM needs to consider each item in that list and generate 1-2 close synonyms / equivalents / analogs that might be used by the target audience as search terms. LLM should produce the initial list of extracted atomic terms/concepts first, following by the list of synonyms / equivalents / analogs.

## Meta 6

Here is a sample output:

**Original Term:** AI-Driven (Characteristic)
- Synonym/Equivalent: Artificial Intelligence Application
- Synonym/Equivalent: Machine Learning Powered

For once, I do not need "**Original Term:**" and "Synonym/Equivalent:" clutter.
Second, I probably do not need generalization, especially generalization that are also broad terms like both of the generated variants in the example above. What I do not see is a fairly close "AI-Assisted" term. I need you amend the prompt to fix all these issues.

Also, consider if you could improve overall structure, like using Markdown headings instead of separators and having overarching instructions before stage 1, because right now it appears like a collection of stages, rather than an integral workflow.

As before, you are not allowed to include specific examples I provided as part of the generated prompt.

## Meta 7

With that prompt, LLM has produced, among other things:

AI-Driven (Characteristic)
- AI-Powered
- Machine Learning Based

Then I asked if the LLM considered "AI-Assisted" as another alternative. The following was a full response. Can we fix this?

---

Yes, I did consider "AI-Assisted" as a potential synonym or alternative phrasing for "AI-Driven" during the process of generating the list for Part 2.

When brainstorming alternatives for a term like "AI-Driven (Characteristic)," a range of related concepts come to mind, including:

- AI-Powered
- AI-Enabled
- AI-Augmented
- AI-Assisted
- Machine Learning Based
- Computationally Driven

The selection for the final list of 1-2 alternatives then involves choosing those that are most closely related, semantically very similar, and likely search terms for the _specific nuance_ of the original term within the context of your manuscript.

For **"AI-Driven (Characteristic),"** the alternatives I provided were:

- AI-Powered
- Machine Learning Based

My reasoning for selecting these two specifically, and perhaps not "AI-Assisted" in that particular slot, was:

1. **Nuance of "Driven" vs. "Assisted":** "AI-Driven" (as used in your title "AI-Driven Scholarly Peer Review") often implies that AI is the primary engine or a central, indispensable force performing or enabling the core of the task. "AI-Assisted," on the other hand, can sometimes imply a more supportive or supplementary role for AI, where a human might still be the primary agent, being _assisted_ by AI tools. While the distinction can be subtle and context-dependent, "AI-Driven" often suggests a stronger or more central agency for the AI.
2. **Closeness to "Characteristic":** The original item was "AI-Driven (Characteristic)." "AI-Powered" and "Machine Learning Based" directly describe the _nature or basis_ of that characteristic â€“ it's powered by AI or based on ML. "AI-Assisted" describes a mode of operation or a relationship (AI assists something/someone) which is slightly different from describing an inherent characteristic of a process.
3. **Search Intent for "AI-Driven":** Someone searching specifically for "AI-Driven" solutions might be looking for systems where the AI takes on a significant portion of the task execution. "AI-Powered" aligns very closely with this. "Machine Learning Based" points to the underlying technology that makes it "AI-Driven."

While "AI-Assisted" is a very relevant and related term in the broader space of AI applications and is certainly a term users might search for when looking for AI involvement in peer review, it implies a slightly different dynamic than "AI-Driven." For the specific task of providing _close_ synonyms or direct alternative phrasings for "AI-Driven (Characteristic)," "AI-Powered" was chosen as a very direct semantic equivalent.

However, it's a valid point that "AI-Assisted" is a highly relevant search term in the general domain. If the goal was to capture a slightly wider net of related search terms for the _concept_ of using AI in peer review (rather than very close synonyms for "AI-Driven" specifically), "AI-Assisted" would be a strong candidate. The instruction to aim for "specificity and direct relevance... very similar semantic roles and meanings... precise concept" led me to the choices made.

## Prompt: Key Concept Extractor and Term Generator

Considering the provided manuscript's title and abstract, please perform the following tasks:
1. **Extract Atomic Keywords for Literature Search:**    
    - Identify and list atomic keywords (do not split compound words).
    - From the **title**: Extract all relevant atomic keywords.
    - From the **abstract**: Extract the top 10 most significant atomic keywords that are distinct from those already extracted from the title.
    - For each keyword, clearly note whether its source is the 'title' or the 'abstract'.
2. **Extract Context for Each Keyword:**
    - For every keyword identified in Step 1:
        - **Identify Keyword Role:** Determine if the keyword, in its specific manuscript location, primarily relates to: (a) a key **methodology** described, (b) the main **application** domain discussed, or (c) **something else** (e.g., a problem, a specific component, a general concept).
        - **Extract Surrounding Textual Context:** From the manuscript, extract the minimalistic linguistic and semantic textual snippet that immediately surrounds the keyword. This extracted text should be just sufficient to:
            - Clearly understand the keyword's meaning and usage in that specific instance.
            - Serve as a self-contained environment for a _separate, later process_ where an alternative keyword (generated elsewhere) could be substituted in place of the original keyword to evaluate its linguistic and semantic appropriateness within this exact extracted textual context.
            - **Do not describe or generate alternative keywords at this stage.** Focus solely on capturing the original keyword's immediate environment and its role.
3. **Generate a Combined JSON Array:**    
    - Compile all extracted keywords and their corresponding contexts (including the keyword's role and its surrounding textual snippet) into a single JSON array. The structure for each element in the array should be:
```
{
    "keyword":          "(KEYWORD_TEXT)",
    "role":             "(methodology/application/other)",
    "source_location":  "(title/abstract)",
    "surrounding_text": "(EXTRACTED_TEXTUAL_SNIPPET_FROM_MANUSCRIPT)"
}
```
4. **Generate a Filtered JSON Array**:
    - From combined JSON array, discard keywords that:
        - have the "other" role OR
        - are introduced in the manuscript OR
        - are relatively uncommon.
5. **Generate Alternatives:**
    - Enrich remaining keywords by adding an array "alternatives" to each JSON5 array member.
    - Each "alternatives" array should include at most 5 related synonyms, direct alternative phrasings, or near-equivalent terms that
        - Might be realistically used as search terms by the target audience. 
        - Fit well linguistically and semantically in place of the extracted keyword in "surrounding_text".
        - Are considered distinct from the extracted keyword by search engines (e.g., alternative word forms or common abbreviation are not distinct).
6. **Generate Top Alternatives:**
    - Combine all alternatives into a single list
    - Discard any keywords that match or are equivalent to any extracted keywords.
    - Select top 20 most common keywords.
    - Out of those, select top 10  most relevant.
