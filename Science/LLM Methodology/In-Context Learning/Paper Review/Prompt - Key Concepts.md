## Meta 1

Help me generate a prompt that will be executed within a chat, which is used to revise a manuscript (so both the manuscript text and target audience are within the LLM's conversational context). The goal of this prompt is to extract key terms and concepts used within the title and abstract yielding a list to be used for subsequent categorization and or search terms generations.

## Meta 2

In addition to "manuscript's primary focus and contributions", perhaps the prompt should also specifically mention applications. Basically, someone reading this list should be able get an idea what the paper's focus/topic (probably covered by "manuscript's primary focus and contributions"), but also target application areas or features. I want to provide clues as to how the "manuscript's primary focus and contributions" might be of practical relevance to the audience. Based on my overall intent, consider how this prompt can be expanded / improved further.
