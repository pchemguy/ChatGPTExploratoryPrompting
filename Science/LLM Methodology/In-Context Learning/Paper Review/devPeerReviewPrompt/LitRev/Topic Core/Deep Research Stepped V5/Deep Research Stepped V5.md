Older literature (published before 2005) should be included only if it meets one or more of the following specific criteria, indicating its crucial and enduring relevance to a foundational understanding of the topic:
    - **High Citation Linkage:** The older work is demonstrably highly cited by numerous primary research articles and reviews within the recent 15-20 year period, indicating its continued influence and foundational status.
    - **Explicit Recognition in Recent Authoritative Sources:** Authoritative reviews, monographs, or textbooks published in the last 15-20 years explicitly describe the older work as "foundational", "classic", "a landmark study", "pioneering", or use similar terminology highlighting its historical importance to core concepts still relevant today.
    - **Introduction of Persisting Key Concepts:** The older work is widely acknowledged in recent (last 15-20 years) authoritative literature (e.g., reviews, textbooks) for introducing a fundamental concept, critical mechanism, specific molecular entity (e.g., a key receptor subtype, enzyme, or metabolite), or essential nomenclature that remains integral to the current understanding of the core research concepts/objects/topics or their related aspects covered in this report.
2. **Source Types:** This report should draw from **primary research articles, scholarly reviews, monographs, and textbooks**. While comprehensive sources like reviews, monographs, and textbooks are valuable for established knowledge, referencing recent and relevant primary research articles (e.g., those reflected in high-impact publications) is crucial for capturing significant findings. Prioritize sources where the core research concepts/objects/topics (or their specified aspects, as detailed below) appear as a **central theme**.
3. **Preferred Source Publishers:** When sourcing information, make a strong effort to prioritize materials from leading academic publishers known for high-quality scientific monographs, textbooks, comprehensive reviews, and impactful primary research relevant to the field of inquiry.
