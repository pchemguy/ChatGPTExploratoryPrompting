### **2. The Neurotransmitter Lifecycle: A Biological Framework**

Provide a detailed, descriptive overview of the biological journey of dopamine to establish the context for subsequent chemical analysis.

- **Synthesis:** Briefly outline the canonical synthesis pathway: Tyrosine → L-DOPA → Dopamine.
- **Vesicular Storage:** Detail the mechanism of dopamine uptake into synaptic vesicles via VMAT2 and describe the complete intragranular storage process.
- **Release:** Describe the mechanisms of exocytosis from presynaptic terminals, including key regulatory factors like neuronal firing patterns and autoreceptor feedback.
- **Receptor Signaling:** Provide a high-level overview of the D1-like (Gs/olf-coupled) and D2-like (Gi/o-coupled) receptor families and their principal downstream signaling cascades.
- **Reuptake:** Analyze the function of the dopamine transporter (DAT), detailing its mechanism, kinetics, and regulation.
- **Metabolic Degradation:** Map the comprehensive enzymatic pathways involving MAO (A/B), COMT, and ALDH that lead to the formation of DOPAC, HVA, and 3-MT. Include enzyme subcellular locations and cofactor requirements.
