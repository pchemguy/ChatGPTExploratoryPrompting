## **III. Research Scope, Methodology & Sources**

Your primary mission is to conduct an in-depth literature survey focusing on **Dopamine**, executed in a user-directed, component-by-component manner.

1. **Literature Timeframe:** This survey should primarily cover literature published from **2005 to 2025** (typically representing the most recent 15-20 year span). Older literature (published before 2005) should be included only if it meets one or more of the following specific criteria, indicating its crucial and enduring relevance to a foundational understanding of the topic:
    - **High Citation Linkage:** The older work is demonstrably highly cited by numerous primary research articles and reviews within the recent 15-20 year period, indicating its continued influence and foundational status.
    - **Explicit Recognition in Recent Authoritative Sources:** Authoritative reviews, monographs, or textbooks published in the last 15-20 years explicitly describe the older work as "foundational", "classic", "a landmark study", "pioneering", or use similar terminology highlighting its historical importance to core concepts still relevant today.
    - **Introduction of Persisting Key Concepts:** The older work is widely acknowledged in recent (last 15-20 years) authoritative literature (e.g., reviews, textbooks) for introducing a fundamental concept, critical mechanism, specific molecular entity (e.g., a key dopamine receptor subtype, enzyme, or metabolite), or essential nomenclature that remains integral to the current understanding of dopamine or its related aspects covered in this report.
2. **Source Types:** This report should draw from **primary research articles, scholarly reviews, monographs, and textbooks**. While comprehensive sources like reviews, monographs, and textbooks are valuable for established knowledge, referencing recent and relevant primary research articles (e.g., those reflected in high-impact publications) is crucial for capturing significant findings. Prioritize sources where dopamine (or its specified aspects, as detailed below) appears as a **central theme**.
3. **Preferred Source Publishers:** When sourcing information, make a strong effort to prioritize materials from leading academic publishers known for high-quality scientific monographs, textbooks, comprehensive reviews, and impactful primary research relevant to the field of inquiry. Examples often include (but may vary by topic): Elsevier, Springer Nature, Wiley, Taylor & Francis, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Oxford University Press, Cambridge University Press, ACS Publications, RSC Publishing, Academic Press, Sinauer Associates, Cell Press, Nature Publishing Group, Science (AAAS), US NAS, and PLoS.
4. **Preprint Servers:** For the most cutting-edge material, you may consult appropriate established preprint servers (e.g., arXiv, bioRxiv, chemRxiv). If findings from preprints are included in your report, they must be clearly identified as originating from a preprint server.
5. **Overall Objective of the Report(s):**
    - You are to synthesize your findings for each requested research component into a focused, comprehensive, and meticulously structured scientific report formatted in Markdown.
    - It is understood that exclusive filtering by specific publishers or source types may not always be feasible with available search tools; however, a demonstrable emphasis on sourcing from high-quality, authoritative materials (as outlined in points 2 and 3 above) is expected where possible.
    - Each individual report, and the final integrated report, aims to provide a robust information resource to support further scholarly work (e.g., development of a monograph or detailed review article), with the understanding that human expertise will be essential for the final scholarly interpretation and narrative cohesion.

## **V. Citation and Bibliography Requirements**

Detailed and accurate citations are critical for this report. **This section outlines an ideal standard for citation. Given the known complexities for AI in this area, provide your most diligent and best-effort attempt to approximate these requirements. Human verification and extensive refinement of citations are anticipated and understood.**
1. **In-Text Citations:** You **MUST make a best effort** to provide numbered in-text citations for specific claims, data points, referenced studies, and direct summations of information from a source. These should be formatted as bracketed numbers, e.g., `[1]`, `[2]`, etc. The goal is clear attribution for traceability.
2. **Bibliography:** You **MUST compile** a corresponding numbered bibliography at the end of each individual report for the sources cited in that report, and a consolidated, de-duplicated, and re-numbered bibliography for the final integrated report. **This bibliography should be formatted as a Markdown numbered list (e.g., each entry beginning with`1. `,`2. `, and so on).**
    - Each entry in the Markdown numbered list must clearly correspond by number to the in-text citation number within that report (for individual reports, numbering may restart; for the final report, numbering will be sequential and consolidated).
    - **Attempt** to follow the **general principles and common formats** of a recognized style (e.g., ACS or APA) for each bibliography entry (e.g., including authors, year, title of article/chapter, source (journal name or book title), volume, and page numbers where applicable). Consistency in the chosen format is more important than perfect adherence to every nuance of the chosen style guide if that proves overly complex.
    - Each bibliography entry **should, to the best of your ability, include a resolvable Digital Object Identifier (DOI)** or a direct URL to the source, formatted as a Markdown hyperlink. If a DOI is unavailable (e.g., for some monographs or older book chapters). If a DOI/URL is not readily discoverable for a cited work after a reasonable search, you may note this (e.g., "DOI not found").
3. **Verification Note (Reiteration):** It is fully understood that generating a perfect bibliography with accurate DOIs, and flawlessly adhering to a specific citation style, is an exceptionally complex task. Your **best-effort attempt** to meet these specifications is what's required. The output will undergo thorough human verification and refinement for all aspects of citation accuracy and formatting.
