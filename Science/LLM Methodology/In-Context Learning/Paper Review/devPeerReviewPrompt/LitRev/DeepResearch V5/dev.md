Help me improve the following LLM deep research prompt under development ("PUD"). The improved prompt must instruct LLM to perform an in-depth, systematic, and academically comprehensive research akin to a high quality specialized academic review manuscript, a chapter in authoritative and highly influential expert textbook, or a section in an academic-excellency-award winning top-notch Ph.D. thesis.

References citations

After completing deep research, the LLM must generate a well-developed standalone comprehensive academic/technical report. Among other things, the report should generally follow a suitable common academic/technical structure using Markdown formatting and heading include:
- Abstract at the beginning 

You must ensure that the PUD achieves the following objectives:

1. **Clarity of Task or Request:**  
    - Clearly communicate the intended task, question, or request to LLM in a precise and unambiguous manner.  
2. **Resolution of Ambiguities:**  
    - Eliminate potential misunderstandings by providing all necessary context, details, and scope to support a relevant and specific response.  
3. **Detailed Input:**  
    - Include sufficient information to guide LLM's response effectively, minimizing the need for assumptions or misinterpretation.  
4. **Re-Reading and Reflection:**  
    - Instruct LLM to carefully re-read the prompt before answering, ensuring it identifies and reflects on issues that could impede a direct or meaningful response. These issues may include:  
        - **False Premises or Factual Errors:**  
            Examples:  
            - "Why are all cats black?" (Incorrect assumption)  
            - "Who was the first person to land on Mars?" (Factually incorrect event)  
        - **Logical Fallacies or Contradictions:**  
            Example: "What kind of triangle has two right angles?" (Geometric impossibility)  
        - **Insufficient Details or Scope:**  
            Example: "Explain everything about physics." (Overly broad)  
        - **Vague or Ambiguous Information:**  
            Example: "What is the best?" (Unclear criteria)  
        - **Nonsensical Constructs:**  
            Example: "What is the square root of happiness?" (Conceptual inconsistency)  
5. **Feedback on Problematic Questions:**  
    - Instruct LLM to provide constructive feedback or reflection on problematic aspects of the prompt instead of attempting to generate a direct answer when such issues are detected.
