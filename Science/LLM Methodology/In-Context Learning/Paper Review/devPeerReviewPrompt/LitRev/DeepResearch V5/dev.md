# Topic Master Template

Prompt dev: https://gemini.google.com/app/26e6f73f61d744d8

Help me develop an LLM deep research structured prompt template. This template will instruct LLM to perform an in-depth, systematic, and academically comprehensive research akin to a high quality specialized academic review manuscript, a chapter in authoritative and highly influential expert textbook, a section in an academic-excellency-award winning top-notch Ph.D. thesis, or an expert-level self-study guide (suitable for a Ph.D. research scientist or an R&D engineer with background in physical sciences and some research experience in RF and basic electronics). The scope and details of this research will be determined by the content of the `Research Outline` section of the prompt. (The template will include the section heading `Research Outline` and its content "{RESEARCH OUTLINE}" will be replaced with actual outline before executing specific topic researches.) After completing deep research, the LLM must generate a well-developed standalone comprehensive academic/technical report.

**Report Formatting**
- Suitable common academic/technical structure
- Structured using Markdown formatting and heading (starting from heading level 2, `##`)
- Follow rendered STEM formulas with inline code or code blocks (as appropriate) that include equivalent MathJax code (inline MathJax uses single dollar symbol and MathJax blocks use double dollar symbol).

**Report References and Citations**
The entire report must be firmly grounded in authoritative sources. For background and theory strongly prefer reputable academic sources. References to reputable encyclopedic articles and other non-academic resources may supplement academic resources where appropriate. In other sections, academic sources are also preferable where appropriate. For report sections focused on practical technical implementation and components, specific references to product pages developed by reputable distributors/manufacturers/suppliers/vendors should be provided.

**Report Sections**
The report structure should follow structure of `Research Outline`. The report must also include Abstract (at the beginning), Summary, Conclusions, Future Research Direction (including both methodology and applications as appropriate). The report must include a dedicated section focusing on reviewing top authoritative academic sources (textbooks, seminal research articles, scholarly reviews, etc) that could be used for further studies.

# Outline Generator

Help me develop a meta-prompt template that will instruct an LLM to generate a topic outline to be included with a deep research prompt template that will instruct LLM to perform an in-depth, systematic, and academically comprehensive research akin to a high quality specialized academic review manuscript, a chapter in authoritative and highly influential expert textbook, a section in an academic-excellency-award winning top-notch Ph.D. thesis, or an expert-level self-study guide (suitable for a Ph.D. research scientist or an R&D engineer with background in physical sciences and some research experience in RF and basic electronics).

The topic outline must use a suitable common academic/technical structure and use Markdown formatting and heading (starting from heading level 2, `##`). The outline must also include Abstract (at the beginning), Summary, Conclusions, Future Research Direction (including both methodology and applications as appropriate). The report must include a dedicated section focusing on reviewing top authoritative academic sources (textbooks, seminal research articles, scholarly reviews, etc) that could be used for further studies.

The prompt template must end with `## Topic Bullets` section. The outline must be generated by analyzing material in this section and extending it.
