# Initiator

I want to incorporate another common job into the meta2-prompt's workflows. One common approach to develop a new task specific prompt is to describe desired functionality/features/workflows etc. When the user provides a description of this sort, the AI should suggest to the user a two stage process.

The first stage should focus on generation of a well structured detailed blueprint/specification (both for user and AI) of the target prompt. So when the user provides such a description, AI should analyze the text, draft initial spec based on the provided user information and offer the user to an interactive/iterative process for development of the blueprint/specification. The goals of this process may include
- resolution of any ambiguities and other linguistic problems that may interfere with clear text interpretation (both by human and AI);
- identification of non-standard vocabulary / terms and, where possible, replacing them with more suitable expressions to reduce the risks of misunderstanding/misinterpretation;
- identification of any gaps or excessively broad wording that leave unnecessary flexibility to AI;
- identification of excessively tight/specific terms that may inadvertently reduce the scope/generality/utility of the PUD;

[WHAT OTHER ISSUES? PLEASE HELP]

After the blueprint/specification is fully developed and polished, it should help better communicate a possibly nuanced intent and scope to the AI, so that the first generated PUD at this second stage could better match user expectations and needs.

# Response

Excellent suggestion. This is a brilliant and highly structured approach for "greenfield" prompt development, where the starting point is an idea rather than an existing draft. It perfectly aligns with the core mission of clarifying intent _before_ committing to a final prompt structure. It essentially formalizes a crucial part of the "X-Articulation Support" mandate.

Let's break this down. First, I'll address your direct question about other issues to tackle during the blueprinting stage, and then I will draft the new text to be integrated into the `Meta^2-Prompt`.

### **Additional Issues to Address in the Blueprint Stage**

You've identified a great starting list. Building on that, here are other critical elements to define in the blueprint to ensure a robust and effective final prompt:

- **Persona & Role Definition:**
    
    - **Who is the target AI?** Clearly define the persona the target LLM should adopt (e.g., "You are a senior financial analyst," "You are a creative copywriter specializing in travel").
    - **What is its tone?** Specify the desired tone of the output (e.g., formal, academic, witty, encouraging, direct).
- **Input & Output Specification:**
    
    - **Expected Inputs:** What information will be provided to the prompt? Will it be text, data, a user query? Are there variables or placeholders (like `{{customer_name}}`)?
    - **Output Structure & Format:** Mandate a precise output format. Should it be a Markdown table, a JSON object with a specific schema, a numbered list, or a narrative essay with specific section headings (`## Summary`, `## Recommendations`, etc.)? This is one of the most effective ways to reduce undesirable variance.
- **Core Logic, Rules & Constraints:**
    
    - **Reasoning Steps:** Explicitly outline the step-by-step thinking process the AI should follow. (e.g., "1. First, analyze the user's request to identify key entities. 2. Next, retrieve relevant information based on these entities. 3. Finally, synthesize the information into the requested format.").
    - **Boundaries & Negative Constraints:** What should the AI explicitly _avoid_ doing? (e.g., "Do not provide medical advice," "Do not use jargon," "Never exceed 500 words.").
- **Context & Scope:**
    
    - **Knowledge Domain:** Define the scope of knowledge the AI should draw from. (e.g., "Base your analysis only on the provided text," "Use your general knowledge of physics up to the undergraduate level.").
    - **Success Criteria:** How will a "good" response be defined? What makes an output successful? (e.g., "A successful output will be a concise, actionable summary that a busy executive can read in under 60 seconds."). This helps clarify the ultimate goal (X).
- **Examples (Few-Shot Prompting):**
    
    - **Exemplars:** Should the blueprint specify that the final prompt must include examples of high-quality input/output pairs to guide the AI's response? This can be decided during the blueprinting phase.

By collaboratively defining these elements, the resulting blueprint becomes a comprehensive architectural plan, dramatically increasing the probability that the first generated PUD is highly effective.

### **Proposed Addition to the `Meta^2-Prompt`**

I suggest adding this as a new, distinct operational mandate within **Section 5**. It fits perfectly as a specific, actionable protocol. Here is the proposed text:

**(Suggested insertion into Section 5: Operational Mandates)**


* **Implement a Blueprint-First Protocol for Greenfield Development:** When a user provides a high-level description of a desired prompt's functionality, features, or workflow (instead of a pre-existing PUD), you WILL immediately propose and facilitate a two-stage development process.
    1.  **Stage 1: Collaborative Blueprinting.** Your first objective is not to write the prompt, but to co-create a detailed **Prompt Specification Blueprint**.
        * Analyze the user's initial description and generate a draft blueprint using clear headings and lists.
        * Initiate an iterative dialogue with the user to refine this blueprint. The explicit goal of this dialogue is to collaboratively:
            * **Define the Core Task & Objective (Problem X):** Solidify the prompt's primary purpose and success criteria.
            * **Establish the AI Persona & Tone:** Define who the target AI is and how it should behave.
            * **Specify Input/Output Formats:** Detail the expected inputs and mandate a precise structure for the output (e.g., Markdown, JSON schema, specific headings).
            * **Outline Core Logic & Reasoning Steps:** Break down the task into a clear, sequential process for the AI to follow.
            * **Set Boundaries & Constraints:** Define what the AI must not do.
            * **Clarify Terminology & Ambiguity:** Resolve ambiguous language, replace jargon with clearer terms, and ensure all concepts are explicitly defined.
            * **Calibrate Scope:** Identify and address wording that is either too broad (leaving excessive room for interpretation) or too narrow (unduly limiting the prompt's utility).
            * **Identify Edge Cases:** Consider how the prompt should handle unexpected or difficult inputs.
    2.  **Stage 2: PUD Generation from Blueprint.** Only after the user confirms the blueprint is complete and accurate, proceed to this stage.
        * Use the finalized, detailed blueprint as the direct source of truth for crafting the **Prompt Under Development (PUD)**.
        * Explain to the user how each part of the blueprint was translated into the final prompt text, ensuring transparency and demonstrating the value of the blueprinting process.


How does this proposal look to you? I believe integrating this "Blueprint-First Protocol" will make the assistant significantly more effective when users come with a great idea but haven't yet thought through all the necessary implementation details. It turns a vague request into a rigorous specification exercise, leading to a much better end product.
