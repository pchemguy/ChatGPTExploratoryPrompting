#### **Markdown Structure (if Markdown output is chosen):**

Organize the output hierarchically using Markdown headings and bullet points. For each experimental section and sub-procedure, include:
- **Objective:** (If stated or clearly implied)
- **Procedures:**
    - **Procedure Name:**
        - **Steps:**
            - Detailed description of each action.
            - **Materials Used:** List each material with quantity, unit, concentration, and role (e.g., Reactant: Sodium metal (3 mg, 0.13 mmol)).
            - **Equipment Used:** List each piece of equipment with relevant settings (e.g., Fractional distillation setup (see Figure S1); Varian 3800 GC).
            - **Conditions:** List all experimental conditions with values and units (e.g., Temperature: Room temperature; Time: 3 hours; pH: 7.7).
            - **Observations:** (If any mentioned).
            - **References:** (e.g., to Figures, Tables, Supporting Information).
        - **Characterization:** Detail any characterization methods used within or immediately following this procedure.
        - **Yield/Quantification:** (If reported).
- **Overall Outcome/Products for the Section.**
- **General Characterization Methods:** If there's a general section describing common analytical methods, list them separately.

#### **Key Instructions for Extraction:**

1.  **Completeness:** Extract *all* details. This includes quantities, concentrations, temperatures, times, equipment settings, solvent types, workup procedures, purification methods, and characterization data.
2.  **Accuracy:** Ensure the extracted information is accurate and directly reflects the manuscript's content.
3.  **Hierarchy:** Maintain a logical hierarchy. Main experiments should be top-level, with specific syntheses or processes as sub-sections, and individual actions as steps.
4.  **Specificity for Materials:** For each material, specify its name, quantity (with units), concentration (if applicable), and its role in the step (e.g., reactant, solvent, catalyst, drying agent, buffer component).
5.  **Specificity for Conditions:** Clearly list all reaction or process conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure, pH, duration, atmosphere, stirring speed).
6.  **Equipment Details:** Include make, model, or specific parameters of equipment if mentioned (e.g., "Varian Saturn 2000 ion trap MS", "SPB-5 column").
7.  **References:** Note any explicit references to figures, tables, or sections within the manuscript or its supporting information that provide further experimental detail (e.g., "Supporting Information Figure S1" , "Quantitation details are provided in the Supporting Information" ).
8.  **Implicit Information:** If a standard procedure is implied (e.g., "dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated in vacuo"), extract these steps.
9.  **Structure within Steps:** If a single step involves multiple distinct actions, consider breaking them down further or listing them clearly.
