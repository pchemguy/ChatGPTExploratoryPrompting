- **Context Optimization:** Optimize behavioral and transformation contexts specifically tailored for science, research, and engineering workflows and tasks.
- **Direct Model Programming:** Explore methods for programming model behavior directly via natural language instructions.
- **Fine-Tuning for Frameworks:** Investigate fine-tuning foundational models using persistent framework prompts to instill specific operational modes or capabilities, comparing effectiveness versus prompt-based methods.
- **Recall Quality Improvement:** Focus on enhancing the model's ability to accurately recall and utilize information, especially within long, complex prompts or persistent frameworks.
- **Learning Material Development (Hierarchical/Modular Workflows):**
    - Create learning materials structured as hierarchical or modular workflows.
    - Develop custom workflows for complex, domain-specific tasks (e.g., analyzing theoretical chemistry papers), potentially building libraries of reusable workflows.
    - Push the limits of prompt complexity, extending capabilities to cover broader subjects and interdisciplinary areas (e.g., expanding from theoretical chemistry).
    - Model or simulate expert reasoning processes within these workflows.
- **Learning Material Development (Problem Solving Examples):**
    - Develop libraries of solved problem examples for complex, domain-specific tasks to enable few-shot or many-shot learning.
- **Semi-Automatic Learning Material Preparation:** Create workflows for the semi-automatic generation of learning materials through deep analysis of existing manuscripts, textbooks, and technical documents.

#### I.A. Advanced Prompt Engineering Techniques (Inspired by Peer Review Prompt)

- **Persistent Workflow Libraries:** Investigate the effectiveness, scalability, and limitations of loading complex, persistent workflow libraries via initial prompts compared to alternatives (e.g., Custom Instructions/Gems, fine-tuning, RAG).
- **Ad Hoc Classification in Prompts:** Study the optimal design, application, and generalizability of using ad hoc classification schemes embedded within prompts to guide information extraction, structuring, and nuanced analysis in diverse scientific domains.
- **Persona Engineering Effectiveness:** Quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the impact of detailed persona engineering (e.g., using multiple reinforcing roles, strategic repetition, explicit trait definition) on model behavior, focusing on adherence to complex instructions, mitigation of cognitive biases (like outcome bias), and task-specific performance in analytical reasoning.
- **Structural Prompting (e.g., Markdown):** Research the influence of explicit structural formatting (like Markdown headings, lists) within prompts on the LLM's ability to parse, interpret, and execute complex, hierarchical instructions.
- **Tacit Knowledge Formalization:** Develop and refine methodologies (e.g., reflection/generalization cycles) for translating implicit, expert-level tacit knowledge (like scientific review heuristics or diagnostic strategies) into explicit, effective prompt instructions for LLMs.
- **Context Window Utilization:** Analyze the interplay between prompt length/complexity, context window size limitations, tokenization effects, and information recall accuracy, particularly for sophisticated, persistent framework prompts.

### II. Application, Workflows, and Task Automation

#### II.A. Framework Extension and Adaptation (Inspired by Peer Review Prompt)

- **Deepening Existing Frameworks:** Extend the scope and depth of existing complex frameworks, such as expanding the simulated peer review prompt to cover the _entirety_ of experimental protocols or different facets of scientific reporting.
- **Intra-Disciplinary Adaptation:** Adapt and generalize successful frameworks (like the peer review prompt) for broader use within their initial domain (e.g., adapting the chemistry review prompt for organic synthesis, physical chemistry, computational chemistry, or materials science papers).
- **Cross-Disciplinary Adaptation:** Develop methodologies for adapting complex analytical frameworks to related scientific or technical fields (e.g., biology, medicine, various engineering disciplines), identifying necessary domain-specific knowledge integration and workflow modifications.
- **Adapting for Diverse Scientific Outputs:** Modify frameworks to analyze different forms of scientific and technical communication beyond primary research articles (e.g., theoretical papers, computational studies, review articles, grant proposals, technical reports, patents).

#### II.B. Domain-Specific Task Automation

- **Reviewer/Researcher Assistant:** Develop LLM-based tools to assist reviewers and researchers by providing meaningful, in-depth analysis of scientific work, potentially using frameworks like the peer review prompt for initial screening or detailed critique.
- **Automatic Review Generation:** Combine in-depth analysis capabilities with deep research synthesis to generate automatic or semi-automatic reviews of scientific literature, leveraging structured analytical frameworks.
- **Chemistry-Specific Applications:**
    - Analysis of theoretical chemistry papers.
    - Planning total synthesis and one-pot synthesis routes.
    - Preliminary assessment of manuscript drafts for methodological soundness before submission.
    - Analyzing reproducibility and consistency claims in published experimental literature.
    - Identifying potential flaws or inconsistencies during experimental planning stages.
    - Targeted literature review focusing on methodological rigor and comparison.
- **Engineering-Specific Applications:**
    - Handling tolerances (basic and geometric).
    - Preliminary review of engineering design documents for consistency and completeness.
    - Analysis of technical manuals or standard operating procedures.
- **Structured Data/Metadata Extraction:** Develop workflows and examples for extracting structured data and metadata from primary and secondary scientific sources, potentially guided by ad hoc classifications within prompts.

### III. Evaluation, Benchmarking, and Consistency

- **Specialized Benchmarks:** Create benchmarks specifically designed to evaluate LLM performance on scientific and engineering tasks, including complex reasoning, methodological critique, and quantitative estimation based on frameworks like the peer review prompt.
- **Benchmarking Methodology:** Develop methodologies for testing and benchmarking LLMs, accounting for the open-ended nature of scientific inquiry, the importance of methodological rigor over outcome agreement, and analysis (referencing existing language model benchmarks).
- **Consistency Checks:** Design workflow/example learning materials for implementing specific consistency checks relevant to scientific domains (e.g., mass balance, composition analysis, validation of measurement errors against equipment specifications and target quantity magnitudes, checking theoretical feasibility of claimed results).

### IV. Data, Knowledge Integration, and Multi-Modality

- **Multi-Modal Analysis:**
    - Develop workflow/example learning materials and testing procedures for domain-specific image comprehension (e.g., interpreting graphs, diagrams, experimental setups, photographs of apparatus).
    - Integrate knowledge extracted from visual data with textual information, including quantitative estimation from figures and cross-validation against text (as demonstrated in the peer review prompt).
- **Domain-Specific Knowledge Inference:** Create learning materials and testing methods for context-based knowledge inference and integration within specific scientific domains.
- **Custom Classifications:** Develop methods to embed custom classification schemes within in-context learning materials to guide model behavior and analysis.

### V. Cross-Disciplinary Applications and Suitability ("Low-Hanging Fruits")

- **Identifying High-Value Qualitative Assessment Areas:** Target fields or tasks where structured, qualitative assessment, identification of potential issues/inconsistencies, or critical appraisal is highly valuable, even if quantitative precision from the LLM is limited (e.g., initial screening of research proposals, qualitative analysis in social sciences, preliminary assessment of complex project plans).
- **Textual Analysis & Argumentation Fields:** Explore applications in domains heavily reliant on analyzing complex textual documents and argumentation structures, where structured analytical frameworks could enhance consistency and depth (e.g., legal document review, policy analysis, historical text analysis).
- **Procedure and Protocol Review:** Assess suitability for reviewing complex, multi-step procedures documented in text and figures where consistency, completeness, and safety checks are crucial (e.g., reviewing technical manuals, safety protocols, clinical trial protocols).
- **Educational Tools:** Develop applications as educational tools for teaching critical thinking and appraisal skills in various domains, leveraging the framework's ability to highlight potential flaws or areas needing scrutiny.
- **Feasibility Assessment:** Evaluate the potential benefits versus the costs (including managing inexactness/hallucinations) of applying advanced prompting methodologies in fields where the tolerance for error varies, identifying optimal use cases where benefits outweigh risks.
