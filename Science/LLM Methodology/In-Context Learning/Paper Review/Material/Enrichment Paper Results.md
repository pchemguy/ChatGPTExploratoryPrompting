- **Inexpensive 17O enrichment protocol from natural abundance water:**
    - **Reason:** Main claimed result.
    - **Approach**: Combination of slow windowsill evaporation and fractional distillation (glass wool packed column).
    - **Achievement:** Reported 90%-99.7% 17O-water (from ~0.04% initial).
- **Initial enrichment of tap water via natural evaporation:**
    - **Reason:** Contributes substantially to the main claimed result, implicit.
    - **Approach**: Slow windowsill evaporation.
    - **Achievement:** Reported "40-fold enrichment" (stated as distillation feed).
- **Practical 17O water enrichment characterization:**
    - **Reason:** Subsidiary finding.
    - **Approach**: Water reaction with BSTFA.
    - **Achievement:** Quantification of HMDS by GC-MS.
- **Observed exchange reaction of primary alcohols with water catalyzed by ketones.**
    - **Reason:** Subsidiary finding.
    - **Approach**: Mixture of ketone/alcohol/17O-water allowed to react.
    - **Observation:** Increased intensity of 17O-exchanged alcohol in presence of ketones.
