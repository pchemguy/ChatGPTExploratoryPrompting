**Acs peer review**  

**A note on peer review**  

Scholar peer review is knowledge and reasoning intensive process involving complex workflows that need to be tailored to specific field/subfield/journal. The inherent complexity of this process is only one reason why peer review is a challenging task for ai systems. Limit availability of review examples that could be used for model training is another reason, though a number of specialized data sets have used for training and testing purposes []. Another

Structured systematic analysis and complex workflows are crucial for preparation of high quality peer reviews. But **these activities largely really on mostly tacit knowledge of high-level experts and are generally time-intensive.**

Perhaps a bigger question would be to what extent tacit knowledge involved in research/engineering/medicine activities can be codified/formalized, that is reduced/decomposed to actionable workflows/structured abstract/generalized protocols involving simpler steps accessible (whatever it means) to SOTA AI.

Problem of generating increasingly abstracting protocols that still elicit detailed and tailored response

Meta-reasoning meta-learning meta-research

Two common strategies for a complex problem, and associated workflows
