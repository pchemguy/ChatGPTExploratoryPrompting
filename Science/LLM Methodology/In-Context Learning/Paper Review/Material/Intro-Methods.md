With rapid evolution of frontier LLM models, their power to handle complex knowledge-intensive tasks and related research also expand rapidly. Of particular interest are domain-specific STEM research activities that continuously put human's intelligence to test and push the boundaries of the knowledge itself.

Reflecting on human education, learning by example, workflow algorithms.

Learning to solve problems of past international chemistry Olympiads by having problem text and a simple answer without solution details - attempting to figuring out solution algorithms/workflows. 

Frontier models are becoming increasingly capable of solving such advanced problems (international subject Olympiads and PhD-level problems). Learning Algorithms/workflows, and not purely from pairs of problems and answers (as opposed to detailed solutions) is essential for mastering complex technical tasks, as can be seen by reflecting on the entire education process, starting from secondary school all the way to the most advanced levels of intellectual training.

A similar trend has been observed with LLMs and development of advanced prompt engineering techniques targeting intellectually taxing tasks.

intellectually challenging
Mentally demanding
Brain-taxing 

When it comes to formalizing complex technical tasks often involving tacit knowledge, one useful approach is reflecting on solution of specific examples in combination with generalization/abstraction (pattern recognition?)

Reflection/introspection is itself a highly individual and convoluted metareasoning process involving a plethora of tacit knowledge
Reflect on reflection
retroactively reconstruct key steps in my reasoning process
learning via analysis and synthesis
learning - analysis - reading
learning - synthesis - learning through writing by trying to develop a cohesive and accessible explanation (implicitly or explicitly involves retrospective analysis / reflection)
