### User Prompt

Help me generate a detailed flow chart that will schematically depict experimental section of the attached manuscript.

### LLM Response

Okay, I can help you generate a detailed flowchart depicting the experimental section of the attached manuscript. Here's a breakdown of the experimental procedures:

#### Experimental Section Flowchart

Below is a schematic representation of the experimental procedures described in the manuscript "Enrichment of H₂¹⁷O from Tap Water, Characterization of the Enriched Water, and Properties of Several ¹⁷O-Labeled Compounds."

#### **I. Enrichment of H₂¹⁷O from Tap Water**

1. **Initial Enrichment by Slow Evaporation**
    - Place tap water (1-2 L) in a shallow black bowl.
    - Allow to evaporate slowly at room temperature on a windowsill until the volume reaches ~20-50 mL.        
2. **Collection and Sterilization**
    - Collect the concentrated water into a measuring cup.
    - Boil briefly in a microwave (~30s, high power) to sterilize.
    - Store the sterilized enriched water in a glass jar with a tight lid.
3. **Accumulation and Filtration**
    - Repeat the evaporation and sterilization process until >1 L of enriched water is accumulated.
    - Filter the accumulated water through fluted filter paper to remove particulate matter.
4. **Fractional Distillation of Enriched Water**
    - **Setup:** (Refer to Supporting Information Figure S1 )
        - Place ~500 mL of filtered enriched water into a 1 L round-bottom flask.
        - Fit with two condensers:
            - Vertical condenser packed with glass wool (not cooled with running water).
            - Tilted condenser at the top (cooled with cold running water).
        - Attach the system to a single-neck still head for fraction collection.
    - **Distillation Process:**
        - Heat the distillation flask with a mantle connected to a Variac (setting: 50), ensuring slow heating for good fractionation.
        - Monitor the boiling point using a thermometer at the top of the fractionation column.            
        - Collect several fractions with different boiling points (e.g., fractions at 98.5°C and 99°C).
