## Discussion and Outlook

- **Development Tools:**
    - Feature-rich Markdown editor, such as [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is essential for plain-text development of complex structured prompts.
    - Using source-code management tools, such as Git/[GitHub](https://github.com) or [Fossil-SCM](https://fossil-scm.org) is advisable (I use them both. Because Obsidian saves changes automatically, I use GitHub/Fossil-SCM as replacement for Ctrl-S in MS Word.)
    - For development of even more complex workflows, special tools for managing complexity, such as tools used for knowledge/information management and/or techniques used for software development, may become necessary.
- **Testing**: The prompt has been developed and tested using a single publication, so testing it on other experimental chemistry manuscripts (and associated further development) is essential.  
- **Scope**:  
    - While I attempted to generalize the prompt text, presently it only attempts to cover in detail only the core experimental protocol (evaporation + distillation stages, which directly implement the main result). Extending the prompt to cover other experimental parts of the manuscript is one of the natural next steps.  
    - Extending the prompt (or creating a separate version) to cover, for instance, theoretical and computational chemistry, as well as developing versions for other science and engineering areas present a significant interest. This direction necessitates direct involvement for field experts for efficient development processes (I am a chemist, but I do not possess the necessary experience to create prototypes for non-experimental branches).  
- **Knowledge codification methodology:** As I discussed in the methodology sections, the way I approached the process of translating the practical knowledge of analysis was by analyzing specific issues of the test paper, posing questions targeting identified issues, and generalizing them. This process necessitates field experts (extensive reviewing experience is desirable) with developed advanced reasoning skills, such as self-reflection and induction/deduction (possibly in a "meta" sense, as the object of generalization on a particular field-specific phenomenon or observation, but questions targeting them). The LLM might also be able to facilitate this process, but the relevant experience also needs to be acquired. Probably, other approaches can be used for achieving the same goal.

Based on the provided description, the AI prompt designed for simulating academic peer review of experimental chemistry manuscripts represents a significant exploration into leveraging advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex, domain-specific analytical tasks. Several key conclusions can be drawn:

1. **Sophisticated In-Context Learning Application:** The prompt demonstrates a highly sophisticated application of in-context learning and prompt engineering. By meticulously structuring instructions using Markdown, employing hierarchical decomposition, and defining detailed workflows (akin to a "workflow library" loaded into context), it guides the LLM through a multi-step critical analysis process typically requiring deep domain expertise. This approach successfully circumvents the need for fine-tuning, specialized APIs, or external tools, making advanced analysis accessible within a standard chat interface.
2. **Codification of Expert Reasoning:** A major achievement lies in the attempt to formalize and codify the often tacit reasoning processes involved in expert peer review. The prompt translates complex analytical steps—such as assessing methodological soundness _independently_ of claimed outcomes, performing quantitative feasibility checks based on fundamental principles, analyzing multimodal data (figures, photos), and applying ad hoc classification—into explicit instructions executable by an LLM.
3. **Emphasis on Methodological Rigor:** The prompt design, particularly through detailed persona engineering and specific workflow instructions, strongly emphasizes methodological rigor over outcome bias. It actively directs the LLM to critically evaluate _how_ experiments were done and whether the methods _could_ theoretically produce the claimed results, a cornerstone of robust scientific critique often challenging even for human reviewers.
4. **Leveraging Advanced LLM Capabilities:** The success and iterative development of this prompt are heavily reliant on the advanced reasoning and multimodal capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs like Gemini Advanced 2.5 Pro. Its complexity pushes the boundaries of what can be achieved solely through prompting, highlighting the importance of powerful underlying models for tackling nuanced, knowledge-intensive tasks.
5. **Potential Value and Applications:** This approach holds potential value as:
    - A **pre-submission tool** for researchers to identify potential flaws in their manuscripts.
    - An **educational resource** for training students in critical analysis and peer review.
    - A **potential supplement** to traditional peer review, offering a consistent, structured first-pass analysis focused on methodological soundness.
    - A **demonstration** of how expert workflows can be captured and automated using LLMs.
6. **Inherent Limitations and Future Directions:** Despite its sophistication, the prompt is subject to the inherent limitations of in-context learning, including context window constraints (which affect the amount of information and examples that can be processed) and potential variability in LLM interpretation and recall. The current implementation focuses analysis on core experimental aspects and requires further development for comprehensive manuscript evaluation. Future work could involve expanding the scope, refining workflows, formally evaluating the prompt's effectiveness across different manuscripts and models, and exploring hybrid approaches that might integrate external knowledge retrieval (RAG) to overcome context limitations for even more complex analyses.

In summary, this work presents a compelling proof-of-concept for using carefully crafted prompts to guide advanced LLMs in performing expert-level scientific manuscript critique. It showcases the power of structured prompt engineering and highlights both the potential and the current limitations of relying solely on in-context learning for highly specialized tasks.
