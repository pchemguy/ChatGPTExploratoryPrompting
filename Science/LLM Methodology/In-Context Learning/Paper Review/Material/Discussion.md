## Discussion and Outlook

- **Testing**: The prompt has been developed and tested using a single publication, so testing it on other experimental chemistry manuscripts (and associated further development) is essential.  
- **Structure:**
    There are probably a number of ways to optimize the current prompt structure. One of the obvious candidates is Section IV.D which is split in two parts as described in methodology section.  This division introduces extra complexity that very well may not be justifiable. Perhaps, the two sections should be collapsed into one to be used for all targets. Scope definition already present in Section IV.A may need to be optimized and extended to provide various analysis options, such as targeting the core experimental protocol only (present focus of Section IV.D.2) or some other component.
- **Scope**:  
    - While I attempted to generalize the prompt text, presently it only attempts to cover in detail only the core experimental protocol (evaporation + distillation stages, which directly implement the main result). Extending the prompt to cover other experimental parts of the manuscript is one of the natural next steps.  
    - Extending the prompt (or creating a separate version) to cover, for instance, theoretical and computational chemistry, as well as developing versions for other science and engineering areas present a significant interest. This direction necessitates direct involvement for field experts for efficient development processes (I am a chemist, but I do not possess the necessary experience to create prototypes for non-experimental branches).  
- **Knowledge codification methodology:** As I discussed in the methodology sections, the way I approached the process of translating the practical knowledge of analysis was by analyzing specific issues of the test paper, posing questions targeting identified issues, and generalizing them. This process necessitates field experts (extensive reviewing experience is desirable) with developed advanced meta-reasoning skills. The LLM might also be able to facilitate this process, but the relevant experience also needs to be acquired. Probably, other approaches can be used for achieving the same goal as well.  
- **Persona Engineering:**
    Role prompting is one of the common techniques used to steer LLMs toward desirable output. It relies on the user's ability to identify a suitable role character and on the model's correct interpretation of the user's intent. In this sense, this technique might be somewhat more opaque, compared, for example to explicit description of the desired behavior. One of the problems with explicit description, however, is that it might be difficult to verbalize the desired behavior to replace an identified well-suitable persona (though in such a case it might be a valid question to ask whether the model will pick the intent that is difficult to express for human). In rather simple cases a persona might as well just be used. For complex domain-specific STEM tasks, here there might be a room for improvement. In the presented version, I have used multiple personas with explicit projected qualities (Section II). Whether such a design is optimal for complex domain-specific STEM problems is an open question.
- **Meta-prompting / meta-reasoning / meta-learning:**
    Automatic/Automated prompt engineering is another interesting topic. Say, given a set of good detailed reviews of experimental chemistry papers, will AI generate a good persona section and reconstruct a generic workflow instruction something in line with (Section IV)? Or something even better for guiding AI through the review process (in place of the chemistry paper review process can be a different scope or task altogether, of course).
- **LLM models - Workflow Tuning:**  
    Instruction tuning is one of the standard features of leading general-purpose models. However, because one of the central ideas behind AI is that it supposed to figure on its own how to transform the input to output, the instructions generally have descriptive / declarative nature, that is they focus on **what** the user wants rather than on **how** to arrive there. More advanced prompting techniques, such as chain-of-thought do shift focus towards the transformation process to some extent. On the other hand, memorized instructions is nothing new either. In this case, there is a very strong emphasis on the transformation process, manifested as elaborate workflows with hierarchical architecture to be stored in working memory and invoked for related user input for subsequent prompts. All tested models demonstrated at least certain capability to follow this pattern, though additional focused research is necessary to see if there are any specific limitations other than, say, context window length, and whether additional tuning of foundational models specifically for this persistent-worklfow-based pattern might be desirable.
- **Multimodal analysis:**



  

  



  



Presented prompt is an early-stage prototype, and, as such, it has a number of obvious limitations (development opportunities).

There are also a number of immediate questions related to the underlying methodology, including its limits and exploring potential variations and further application to research and engineering tasks.

Based on the provided description, the AI prompt designed for simulating academic peer review of experimental chemistry manuscripts represents a significant exploration into leveraging advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex, domain-specific analytical tasks. Several key conclusions can be drawn:

1. **Sophisticated In-Context Learning Application:** The prompt demonstrates a highly sophisticated application of in-context learning and prompt engineering. By meticulously structuring instructions using Markdown, employing hierarchical decomposition, and defining detailed workflows (akin to a "workflow library" loaded into context), it guides the LLM through a multi-step critical analysis process typically requiring deep domain expertise. This approach successfully circumvents the need for fine-tuning, specialized APIs, or external tools, making advanced analysis accessible within a standard chat interface.
2. **Codification of Expert Reasoning:** A major achievement lies in the attempt to formalize and codify the often tacit reasoning processes involved in expert peer review. The prompt translates complex analytical steps—such as assessing methodological soundness _independently_ of claimed outcomes, performing quantitative feasibility checks based on fundamental principles, analyzing multimodal data (figures, photos), and applying ad hoc classification—into explicit instructions executable by an LLM.
3. **Emphasis on Methodological Rigor:** The prompt design, particularly through detailed persona engineering and specific workflow instructions, strongly emphasizes methodological rigor over outcome bias. It actively directs the LLM to critically evaluate _how_ experiments were done and whether the methods _could_ theoretically produce the claimed results, a cornerstone of robust scientific critique often challenging even for human reviewers.
4. **Leveraging Advanced LLM Capabilities:** The success and iterative development of this prompt are heavily reliant on the advanced reasoning and multimodal capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs like Gemini Advanced 2.5 Pro. Its complexity pushes the boundaries of what can be achieved solely through prompting, highlighting the importance of powerful underlying models for tackling nuanced, knowledge-intensive tasks.
5. **Potential Value and Applications:** This approach holds potential value as:
    - A **pre-submission tool** for researchers to identify potential flaws in their manuscripts.
    - An **educational resource** for training students in critical analysis and peer review.
    - A **potential supplement** to traditional peer review, offering a consistent, structured first-pass analysis focused on methodological soundness.
    - A **demonstration** of how expert workflows can be captured and automated using LLMs.
6. **Inherent Limitations and Future Directions:** Despite its sophistication, the prompt is subject to the inherent limitations of in-context learning, including context window constraints (which affect the amount of information and examples that can be processed) and potential variability in LLM interpretation and recall. The current implementation focuses analysis on core experimental aspects and requires further development for comprehensive manuscript evaluation. Future work could involve expanding the scope, refining workflows, formally evaluating the prompt's effectiveness across different manuscripts and models, and exploring hybrid approaches that might integrate external knowledge retrieval (RAG) to overcome context limitations for even more complex analyses.

In summary, this work presents a compelling proof-of-concept for using carefully crafted prompts to guide advanced LLMs in performing expert-level scientific manuscript critique. It showcases the power of structured prompt engineering and highlights both the potential and the current limitations of relying solely on in-context learning for highly specialized tasks.
