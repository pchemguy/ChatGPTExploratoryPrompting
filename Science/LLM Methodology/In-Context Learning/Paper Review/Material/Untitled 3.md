- Inexpensive 17O enrichment protocol from natural abundance (0.037%) water:
    - **Reason:** Main claimed result.
    - **Approach**: Combination of slow evaporation and fractional distillation.
    - **Achievement:** 90%-99.7% 17O-water.
- Initial enrichment of tap water via natural evaporation:
    - **Reason:** Contributes substantially to the main claimed result, implicit.
    - **Approach**: Natural evaporation.
    - **Achievement:** 40-fold enrichment.
- Practical 17O water enrichment characterization:
    - **Reason:** Subsidiary finding.
    - **Approach**: Water reaction with BSTFA.
    - **Achievement:** Quantification of HMDS by GC-MS.
- Observed exchange reaction of primary alcohols with water catalyzed by ketones.
    - **Reason:** Subsidiary finding.
    - **Approach**: Mixture of ketone/alcohol/17O-water was left to stand overnight.
    - **Observation:** Increased intensity of 17O-exchanged alcohol in presence of ketones.
