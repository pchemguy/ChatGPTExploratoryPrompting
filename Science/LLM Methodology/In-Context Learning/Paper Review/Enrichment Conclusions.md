An inexpensive, straightforward method for enriching <sup>17</sup>O-labeled water from tap water and the subsequent preparation of <sup>17</sup>O-labeled hydrogen peroxide from electrolysis of H<sub>2</sub><sup>17</sup>O are described in this paper. The fractional distillation method for enrichment of H<sub>2</sub><sup>17</sup>O reported here can greatly enrich the percentage of H<sub>2</sub><sup>17</sup>O or H<sub>2</sub><sup>18</sup>O which are both useful for isotope studies. From approximately 500 mL of 40-fold enriched water, about 90 mL of H<sub>2</sub><sup>17</sup>O was obtained. The most practical method for determining the enrichment was found to be the reaction of the H<sub>2</sub><sup>17</sup>O with BSTFA to yield hexamethyldisiloxane which was quantified by GC-MS analysis. Five other <sup>17</sup>O-labeled compounds were also prepared from the <sup>17</sup>O-labeled water (sodium hydroxide, 1-hexanol, hydrogen peroxide, trimethylsilanol, and camphor) and characterized by NMR and GC-MS. This illustrates the power of <sup>17</sup>O NMR in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups. Finally, an unexpected exchange reaction of primary alcohol moieties with water, facilitated by ketones, was detected by <sup>17</sup>O NMR.
