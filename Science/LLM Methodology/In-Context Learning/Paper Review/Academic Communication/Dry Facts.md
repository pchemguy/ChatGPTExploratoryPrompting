## Answer

### "Dry Fact": An Uncommon and Generally Discouraged Term in Academic Summaries

In the realm of academic writing, particularly in abstracts and conclusions, the term "dry fact" is not a common or recommended descriptor for the presentation of information. While the core of academic summaries is to convey factual findings, the phrase "dry fact" carries a negative connotation, suggesting a lack of interpretation, context, and engagement, which are crucial elements of effective scholarly communication.

Academic writing style guides and resources consistently advise against presenting information as isolated, "dry" statements. Instead, they emphasize the importance of creating a narrative that connects the facts, explains their significance, and places them within the broader context of the research field. The goal is to present findings in a manner that is not only accurate but also compelling and insightful to the reader.

Analysis of writing advice reveals a clear preference for more dynamic and interpretive language. For instance, rather than simply stating a "dry fact," scholars are encouraged to:

- **Present key findings or results:** This terminology is standard and accurately reflects the outcome of the research.
- **Offer data-driven insights:** This phrase implies that the facts are not just presented but have been analyzed to yield meaningful conclusions.
- **Use concise and objective language:** This is the preferred way to describe a straightforward presentation of information without the negative implication of being "dry" or uninteresting.
- **Incorporate storytelling:** Even in scientific writing, a narrative structure can be used to guide the reader through the research question, methodology, results, and conclusion in a more engaging way.
- **Employ vivid and precise words:** Choosing strong verbs and specific nouns can make the writing more impactful without sacrificing objectivity.

The term "dry fact" is more likely to be used in a critical context, where an author is being critiqued for failing to provide sufficient analysis or for presenting data in a boring or uninspired manner. Therefore, when crafting academic summaries, it is advisable to focus on presenting "key findings" and "significant results" with clear "interpretations" and "implications," rather than aiming to deliver what might be perceived as mere "dry facts."
