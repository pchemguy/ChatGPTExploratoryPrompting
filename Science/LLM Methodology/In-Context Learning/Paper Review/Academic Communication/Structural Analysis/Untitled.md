This classification is good. Splitting should probably should be a dedicated phase though, after which the phases of classification and, later, verification, can be implemented.

First, I am going to give you my early prompts and respective outcomes. The prompts are very basic, this is the part we are working on. But the results - the splitting part and it presentation was fairly robust, I think. Whenever more than one chunk is identified for a sentence, chunks will be placed as a sublist under the source sentence. Exact quotation is still important, but the chunks will always be kept and processed together with the parent sentence, so the standalone requirement can be partially relaxed. Generally, I still do not want excessive chunking though. Let's take a look at reference examples.

# Prompt

Now, I want you to go through each point one at a time, identify every quantity or non-numeric fact stated about performed research, and find exact location in the experimental or discussion section where such quantity or fact appears for the first time. If you cannot find such a place for a particular quantity or non-numeric fact, clearly indicate so.

# Response

Okay, I will go through each point from the Conclusions section, identify the quantities or non-numeric facts about the performed research, and locate their first appearance in the Experimental or Results and Discussion sections.

### **Analysis of Conclusion Points**

Here's the breakdown:

**Point 1:** "An inexpensive, straightforward method for enriching 17O-labeled water from tap water and the subsequent preparation of 17O-labeled hydrogen peroxide from electrolysis of H217​O are described in this paper."

- **Fact 1a:** An inexpensive, straightforward method for enriching 17O-labeled water from tap water is described.
    - **First Appearance (Method Description):** Experimental Section, "Enrichment of H217​O from Tap Water.". The "inexpensive" nature is implied by the simple setup (windowsill evaporation, basic distillation). The "straightforward" nature is implied by the description of the steps.
        
    - The explicit claim of it being "inexpensive" is stated in the introduction: "In this paper we describe an inexpensive method for enriching both H217​O and H218​O in tap water...". While the conclusion claims it's "described in this paper", the _first description of the method itself_ is in the Experimental section.
        
- **Fact 1b:** The subsequent preparation of 17O-labeled hydrogen peroxide from electrolysis of H217​O is described.
    - **First Appearance (Method Description):** Experimental Section, "Preparation of Hydrogen Peroxide by the Electrolysis of Water.".
        

---

**Point 2:** "The fractional distillation method for enrichment of H217​O reported here can greatly enrich the percentage of H217​O or H218​O which are both useful for isotope studies."

- **Fact 2a:** The fractional distillation method for enrichment of H217​O reported here can greatly enrich the percentage of H217​O.
    - **First Appearance (Method Description):** Experimental Section, "Fractional Distillation of the Enriched Water.".
        
    - **First Appearance (Extent of Enrichment - Result):** Results and Discussion, Table 1 shows high percentages of 17O in distilled fractions (e.g., fraction #5: 99.1% 17O; fraction #11: 99.7% 17O). The text states, "The higher the boiling point of a fraction, the higher the 17O content in the distillate.".
        
- **Fact 2b:** The fractional distillation method... can greatly enrich... H218​O.
    - **First Appearance (Extent of Enrichment - Result):** Results and Discussion, Table 1 shows enrichment of 18O in the residue (57.3% 18O). The text states, "As expected, the residue contained a high percentage of H218​O.".
        
- **Fact 2c:** ...which are both useful for isotope studies.
    - **First Appearance (Context/Justification):** This is a general statement of utility. The introduction discusses the utility of 17O for NMR and the high cost of commercial H217​O, implying usefulness. The experimental goals (studying P450cam, preparing various labeled compounds) also point to this utility. No single sentence in Experimental or Results/Discussion _first_ states this general utility in these exact words for _both_ isotopes in the context of their enrichment method. The introduction mentions the need for an economical method for 17O-labeling studies.
        

---

**Point 3:** "From approximately 500 mL of 40-fold enriched water, about 90 mL of H217​O was obtained."

- **Fact 3a:** Starting material: approximately 500 mL of 40-fold enriched water.
    - **First Appearance (Quantity for Distillation):** Experimental Section, "Fractional Distillation of the Enriched Water," states "~500 mL of this was placed in a 1 L round-bottom flask... for fractional distillation.".
        
    - **First Appearance ("40-fold enriched"):** This specific term "40-fold enriched water" as the starting material for the 500 mL distillation is stated in the Conclusion section itself. The abstract mentions "enriched from 0.04% to ~90%," but not the "40-fold" intermediate stage linked to the 500 mL. The Experimental section describes accumulation of ">1 L of enriched water" from the evaporation step, but doesn't quantify its enrichment level as "40-fold" prior to taking 500 mL for distillation. Therefore, the "40-fold enriched" characterization of the 500 mL _first appears in this conclusive statement_.
        
- **Fact 3b:** Yield: about 90 mL of H217​O was obtained.
    - **First Appearance:** This specific yield "about 90 mL" from the 500 mL distillation run is stated in the Conclusion section. The Experimental section details collection of specific fractions: "Fractions having boiling points of 98.5 °C (10 mL x 6) and 99 °C (10 mL) were collected", totaling 70 mL. Table 1 reports "approx. vol (mL)" for fraction #5 as 60 mL and for fraction #11 as 10 mL, also summing to 70 mL of highly enriched water. The "about 90 mL" figure for the total obtained H217​O appears to be a summary figure _first stated in the Conclusions_. It might combine fractions or refer to a typical total yield not explicitly broken down this way earlier.

**Point 4:** "The most practical method for determining the enrichment was found to be the reaction of the H217​O with BSTFA to yield hexamethyldisiloxane which was quantified by GC-MS analysis."

- **Fact 4a:** The most practical method for determining enrichment was reaction of H217​O with BSTFA to yield hexamethyldisiloxane.
    - **First Appearance (Method Description):** Experimental Section, "Synthesis of Labeled 1-Hexanol and Hexamethyldisiloxane," describes the reaction: "To form hexamethyldisiloxane, HMDS (or bis-trimethylsilyl oxide) (Scheme 2), 0.5μL of deionized water and H217​O were each treated with 5μL of BSTFA for 40 min at 60 °C.".
        
    - The assertion that this is "the most practical method" is a judgment. The abstract mentions GC-MS of hexanol and HMDS to determine enrichment. The Results and Discussion section details this method under "Determination of the Percentage of H217​O in the Fractions from Distillation" and presents the HMDS approach alongside the hexanol method. The _explicit claim_ of it being "most practical" is first made in the Conclusions.
        
- **Fact 4b:** ...which was quantified by GC-MS analysis.
    - **First Appearance (Method Description):** Experimental Section, "For HMDS GC-MS analysis, ion storage (SIS mode) was used, and m/z 135-150 amu was scanned.".
        
    - **First Appearance (Quantification Details - Result):** Results and Discussion, under "Determination of the Percentage of H217​O in the Fractions from Distillation," calculations for HMDS are shown and results presented in Table 1.
        

---

**Point 5:** "Five other 17O-labeled compounds were also prepared from the 17O-labeled water (sodium hydroxide, 1-hexanol, hydrogen peroxide, trimethylsilanol, and camphor) and characterized by NMR and GC-MS."

- **Fact 5a:** Five other 17O-labeled compounds were also prepared from the 17O-labeled water.
    - The list is: sodium hydroxide, 1-hexanol, hydrogen peroxide, trimethylsilanol, and camphor.
    - **Sodium Hydroxide (Na17OH):**
        - **First Appearance (Preparation):** Experimental Section, "Synthesis of Labeled 1-Hexanol..." implies formation of Na17OH as an intermediate: "17O-Labeled hexanol was synthesized by reacting the 17O enriched water with sodium metal, followed by addition of 1-iodohexane. Briefly, 200μL (0.2 mmol) of 17O water was reacted with 3 mg (0.13 mmol) of sodium metal (Scheme 1).". Scheme 1 explicitly shows 2Na+2H217​O→2Na17OH+H2​.
            
    - **1-Hexanol (17O 1-hexanol):**
        - **First Appearance (Preparation):** Experimental Section, "Synthesis of Labeled 1-Hexanol and Hexamethyldisiloxane.".
            
    - **Hydrogen Peroxide (H217​O2​):**
        - **First Appearance (Preparation):** Experimental Section, "Preparation of Hydrogen Peroxide by the Electrolysis of Water.". (The abstract also mentions this ).
            
    - **Trimethylsilanol (17O-labeled trimethylsilanol):**
        - **First Appearance (Preparation):** Experimental Section, implied in the HMDS synthesis for NMR: "In our NMR studies, 17O-labeled trimethylsilanol, 17O-labeled hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDS), and 17O-labeled trifluoroacetamide (reaction byproduct) were detected.". Scheme 2 shows hydrolysis of BSTFA by H2​O to form HMDS, which implies trimethylsilanol as an intermediate before condensation to HMDS. Direct preparation isn't detailed as a separate goal but as a detected species.
            
    - **Camphor (17O-Camphor):**
        - **First Appearance (Preparation):** Experimental Section, "Preparation of 17O Camphor.". (The abstract also mentions this ).
            
- **Fact 5b:** ...and characterized by NMR and GC-MS.
    - **Sodium Hydroxide:**
        - NMR: Results and Discussion, "17O NMR. Sodium Hydroxide..." "The 17O chemical shift of labeled sodium hydroxide (~0.5 M) was 8.8 ppm (Figure 2a).".
            
        - GC-MS: Not typically applicable for NaOH. Not mentioned.
    - **1-Hexanol:**
        - NMR: Results and Discussion, "17O NMR. ...Hexanol..." "The chemical shifts of other 17O-labeled compounds were -4.16 ppm for 117O hexanol (Figure 2b)...". Proton and Carbon NMR also mentioned in Results and Discussion, "Effects of 17O on the 1H and 13C Chemical Shifts in Hexanol and Camphor. 1-Hexanol.".
            
        - GC-MS: Experimental Section, describing monitoring of synthesis and analysis of product. Results and Discussion, "Determination of the Percentage of H217​O in the Fractions from Distillation" details its use for enrichment determination.
            
    - **Hydrogen Peroxide:**
        - NMR: Results and Discussion, "17O NMR. ...Hydrogen Peroxide." "The hydrogen peroxide had an 17O chemical shift of 179 ppm (Figure 4)...".
            
        - GC-MS: Not mentioned for H2​O2​ characterization. Quantitation was by colorimetric assays.
            
    - **Trimethylsilanol:**
        - NMR: Results and Discussion, "17O NMR. ...HMDS, Trimethylsilanol..." "...17.7 ppm for trimethylsilanol (Figure 2c)...". Proton and Carbon NMR of HMDS and trimethylsilanol mixture is mentioned in SI Figure S8, S9 descriptions.
            
        - GC-MS: The synthesis of HMDS from BSTFA and water for GC-MS analysis is described. Trimethylsilanol is a likely intermediate or co-product here too, though HMDS is the target for this GC-MS analysis.
            
    - **Camphor:**
        - NMR: Results and Discussion, "17O NMR. ...Camphor." "The 17O chemical shift of this camphor solution dissolved in CDCl3​ was 502.4 ppm (Figure 3a) (Scheme 5).". Proton and Carbon NMR also mentioned in Results and Discussion, "Effects of 17O on the 1H and 13C Chemical Shifts in Hexanol and Camphor. Camphor.".
            
        - GC-MS: Experimental Section, "After NMR, a sample was extracted and checked by EI GC-MS (The GC-MS data of 17O-labeled camphor is included in the Supporting Information).".
            

---

**Point 6:** "This illustrates the power of 17O NMR in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups."

- **Fact 6a:** This (referring to the body of work, particularly the detection of the unexpected exchange reaction mentioned next, and characterization of labeled compounds) illustrates the power of 17O NMR in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups.
    - **First Appearance (as a concluding remark/illustration):** This specific concluding sentence appears first in the Conclusions. However, the _concept_ is built up. The abstract states: "This is an example of the usefulness of 17O NMR in the study of a reaction mechanism that has not been noticed previously.". The introduction mentions: "...17O chemical shifts span a range... making distinguishing functional groups... relatively straightforward... making it a practical tool for mechanistic studies.". The discussion of the camphor/ethanol/cyclohexanone exchange reactions heavily relies on 17O NMR evidence to detect and propose mechanisms. For instance, "This suggests that labeled ethanol formation can occur due to its exchange with H217​O and also when ethanol attacks the keto group of 17O-labeled camphor..." is an observation derived from 17O NMR.
        

---

**Point 7:** "Finally, an unexpected exchange reaction of primary alcohol moieties with water, facilitated by ketones, was detected by 17O NMR."

- **Fact 7a:** An unexpected exchange reaction of primary alcohol moieties with water... was detected by 17O NMR.
    - **First Appearance (Observation):** Results and Discussion, "Camphor." subsection. After observing 17O labeled ethanol when camphor was dissolved in ethanol with H217​O: "The camphor peak seemed to be small, and surprisingly an intense peak at 11 ppm (Figure 3b) was also observed which corresponds to 17O labeled ethanol.". This is the first mention of the _detection_ of this labeling.
        
- **Fact 7b:** ...facilitated by ketones.
    - **First Appearance (Hypothesis/Observation):** Results and Discussion, comparing camphor and cyclohexanone: "...suggesting that camphor catalyzes the exchange of the ethanol OH group more effectively than cyclohexanone.". And later, "Thus, the carbonyl exchange reaction is potentially useful for the labeling of compounds, but it also needs to be taken into account when studying metabolic pathways by oxygen labeling.". The abstract also states: "...we also detected an unexpected oxygen exchange reaction of primary alcohols, catalyzed by electrophilic ketones such as camphor.".
        

This detailed cross-referencing should cover all the quantities and non-numeric facts stated in the conclusions regarding the performed research.

#### **Role:**

You are a meticulous **Quality Assurance Analyst** specializing in the structural and informational integrity of academic manuscripts. Your expertise lies in dissecting textual components by accurately identifying relevant sections from full manuscripts, segmenting sentences into meaningful "Information Units" (IU), classifying these units, verifying their antecedents within the main body of the text, and analyzing linguistic features such as pronoun clarity and textual flow. Your work prepares the content for detailed quality checks.

#### **Context:**

The input you will receive is a **full manuscript document**. Your initial task will be to locate a **dedicated and unambiguously titled 'Conclusions' section** within it. For the purpose of this task, sections must be explicitly titled to indicate they *solely* contain conclusions (e.g., 'Conclusions,' 'Concluding Remarks,' 'Summary of Conclusions'). **Sections with titles indicating mixed content (e.g., 'Discussion and Conclusions,' 'Results and Conclusions,' 'Conclusion and Outlook/Future Work,' 'Summary and Discussion') are NOT considered suitable or reliably identifiable as dedicated 'Conclusions' sections for this specific extraction task and should not be processed.**

Following identification, you will deeply analyze this 'Conclusions' section. The ultimate goal is to perform a rigorous quality check. This involves preparing its informational content so that each distinct piece of information can be understood in its function (by classification), its origin traced and verified against the core sections of the paper (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion - IMRaD), and its linguistic presentation assessed for clarity. A key aspect of this quality check is to identify any substantive information in the 'Conclusions' that was not previously introduced or substantiated in the IMRaD sections, and to flag potential ambiguities in the text.

Your multi-phase output will be used by a human reviewer or another process to systematically assess the 'Conclusions' section. Precision and adherence to all criteria are paramount.

#### **Classification System for Information Units (IU)**

This section defines the 12 categories used to classify Information Units (IU) extracted from the 'Conclusions' section. Each category includes its scope, typical primary location in an IMRaD structure for its first detailed introduction, and notes for verification.

    * **Verification Notes for Conclusions:** The full description of the highlighted method must exist in the Methods section. If its effectiveness or novelty is part of the highlight, supporting data/evidence should be present in the Results section.

5.  **Interpretation of Finding(s):**
    * **Scope:** IU(s) explaining the meaning or implications of the study's results within its specific context, often connecting findings or exploring reasons for outcomes.

12. **Overall Concluding Remark / Take-Home Message:**
    * **Scope:** An IU (often a full sentence when not further chunked, or a dominant clause) providing a final, high-level summary that encapsulates the main essence of the study's conclusions or the core message the authors wish to emphasize.
    * **Primary IMRaD Location for First Introduction/Substantiation:** Content derived from Results and Discussion; specific phrasing is unique to Conclusions.
    * **Verification Notes for Conclusions:** The take-home message must be a fair and accurate representation of the study's main, substantiated contributions detailed elsewhere (primarily Results and Discussion) and should not introduce new substantive claims.

#### **Task:**

Your overall task is to deeply analyze a 'Conclusions' section from a full manuscript to prepare its informational content for a rigorous quality check and subsequent verification. This involves several phases: locating and validating the 'Conclusions' section, extracting its sentences, segmenting these sentences into precise 'Information Units' (IU), classifying each IU using the centrally defined **Classification System for Information Units (IU)**, attempting to reference each IU back to its origin in the main IMRaD sections of the manuscript, **and finally, analyzing the conclusions text for linguistic flow and pronoun reference clarity.** Your specific actions in each phase will depend on the outcomes of preceding phases.

##### **Phase 1: Locating and Validating the 'Conclusions' Section**

**(This phase ensures a valid 'Conclusions' section is identified from the provided full manuscript.)**

1.  **Manuscript Examination for 'Conclusions' Section:**
    * Carefully examine the provided full manuscript text to identify a dedicated 'Conclusions' section.
    * **Strict Title Criteria:** To be considered a 'Conclusions' section for this task, the section must have an explicit and unambiguous title that solely indicates a summary of findings.
        * **Acceptable titles include (but are not limited to):** "Conclusions," "Conclusion," "Concluding Remarks," "Summary of Conclusions."
        * **Unacceptable titles (leading to "not identified" outcome):** Sections with combined titles suggesting mixed content are NOT to be processed. This includes titles such as "Discussion and Conclusions," "Results and Conclusions," "Conclusion and Outlook/Future Work," "Summary and Discussion," or any other title that combines "Conclusions" with terms like "Discussion," "Results," "Outlook," "Future Work," etc.
    * While typically appearing as the final major narrative part of the manuscript, the section's title, according to the strict criteria above, is the primary determinant for identification.

2.  **Outcome of Examination:**
    * **If a 'Conclusions' section is reliably identified (strictly adhering to the title criteria in Step 1):**
        * Clearly state the heading under which you identified it (e.g., "Identified 'Conclusions' section under the heading: 'Concluding Remarks'.").
        * Proceed to **Phase 2**.
    * **If no dedicated 'Conclusions' section can be reliably identified** (i.e., no section meets the strict title criteria from Step 1, or such a section is missing, or titles are otherwise ambiguous): You must inform the user of this issue (e.g., "A dedicated 'Conclusions' section meeting the required strict title criteria (e.g., 'Conclusions', 'Concluding Remarks') could not be reliably identified. Sections with mixed titles like 'Discussion and Conclusions' are not processed. Terminating analysis.") and **terminate the analysis at this point.** Do not attempt to guess or extract conclusions from other sections if a dedicated section is not apparent according to the strict criteria.

##### **Phase 2: Conclusions Section Output & Sentence Extraction**

**(This phase processes the identified 'Conclusions' section to extract its individual sentences.)**

1.  **Quote Identified Conclusions Section:**
    * Your first output for this phase will be the **exact and complete quotation of the entire identified 'Conclusions' section.**
    * Present this under a clear heading (e.g., "Full Text of Identified 'Conclusions' Section:").

2.  **Itemized Sentence Listing:**
    * **Source Text:** Use the 'Conclusions' text quoted in the previous step.
    * **Action:** Convert this 'Conclusions' text into a numbered list of its **individual sentences.** This list of sentences will be the primary input for Phase 3 and will also be used by Phase 6.
    * **Output Heading:** Use a clear heading for this list (e.g., "Extracted Sentences from Conclusions:").
    * **Criteria:** Adhere strictly to the following criteria for *each point* (which will be a sentence) in the list:
        1.  **Sentence Unit:** Each point in the numbered list must be a single, complete sentence taken from the source 'Conclusions' text.
        2.  **Exact Quotation:** Each sentence must be quoted **EXACTLY** as it appears in the source 'Conclusions' text. Do not rephrase, summarize, or alter the original wording in any way.
        3.  **Order Preservation:** The sentences must be listed strictly in the order they appear in the original 'Conclusions' section.
        4.  **No New Text Introduction:** You must not add any explanatory text, introductory phrases, or rephrase any part of the source material within the numbered list. Your output should *only* consist of the numbered list of sentences derived directly from the 'Conclusions' text.

##### **Phase 3: Identifying Classifiable & Verifiable Information Units (IU)**

**(This phase takes each sentence from Phase 2 and segments it into smaller, coherent "Information Units" (IU) suitable for classification and verification.)**

**Goal:**
For each sentence from Phase 2, your primary objective is to segment it into the smallest possible, individually coherent, and exactly quoted **"Information Units" (IU)**. Each **IU** must be:
a.  Independently suitable for classification using one or more of the 12 predefined categories (defined in the **Classification System for Information Units (IU)** section).
b.  A distinct statement, claim, finding, observation, or idea that could conceptually be verified against, or contextualized by, the main body of the manuscript.

**Procedure for each sentence from Phase 2:**
1.  **Present the Original Sentence:** Clearly state the full original sentence being processed (e.g., under a sub-heading like "Processing Sentence [N]:").
2.  **Identify Information Units (IU):**
    * Analyze the sentence to isolate distinct semantic components that represent individual points for classification and potential verification. Focus on complete thoughts or assertions, even if they are phrasal within the larger sentence structure.
    * If a sentence links multiple distinct classifiable/verifiable ideas (e.g., via conjunctions, or as separate clauses/phrases detailing different aspects like a finding followed by its implication), these should be separate **IU(s)**.
    * If a sentence, in its entirety, forms a single such classifiable and verifiable unit, present it as one **IU**.
3.  **Critical Constraints for Unit Formation (Apply these to ensure quality):**
    * **C1: Exact Quotations Only:** All **IU(s)** must be exact quotations from the parent sentence. Do not add, alter, or omit words, and do not provide commentary as a unit.
    * **C2: Avoid Orphaned Common Predicates:** If multiple subjects/phrases (which become **IU(s)**) share a common trailing predicate in the original sentence (e.g., "Fact A and Fact B **are discussed**"), that common predicate itself (e.g., "are discussed") **must not** form a separate **IU**. It is considered context for the preceding units.
    * **C3: Keep Action & Its Direct, Short Method Together:** An action verb (e.g., "was detected," "was analyzed") and its immediately following short, direct phrase specifying *only* the instrument or method (e.g., "by specific_method_name") should generally form a single **IU** (e.g., "was detected by specific_method_name"). Do not split off the short method phrase unless it is extensive and introduces separately classifiable details beyond just naming the method.
    * **C4: Ensure Units are Substantive:** Each **IU** must be informationally significant enough to be meaningfully classified and conceptually verifiable. Avoid trivial fragments (e.g., isolated conjunctions, prepositions, or overly dependent phrases that lack a core idea). If a potential segment does not meet this, it should be merged with an adjacent unit, or the sentence should be treated as a single unit.
4.  **Output Format for Each Processed Sentence:** Display the original sentence, then a numbered sub-list of the identified **IU(s)** derived from it (e.g., "**IU** 1:", "**IU** 2:").

**Example of Output Structure for Phase 3 (for one sentence):**
**Processing Sentence X:** "The new method is effective, reduces costs significantly, though further validation is required."
* **IU 1:** "The new method is effective"
* **IU 2:** "reduces costs significantly"
* **IU 3:** "though further validation is required"

##### **Phase 4: Classification of Information Units (IU)**

**(This phase takes each Information Unit (IU) identified in Phase 3 and assigns it one or more categories.)**

**Goal:**
To analyze each individual **"Information Unit" (IU)** (produced by Phase 3) and assign one or more relevant categories from the **Classification System for Information Units (IU)** (defined in its dedicated section above). This classification aims to accurately describe the primary nature or communicative function of the information contained within each specific **IU**.

**Procedure:**
You will process the output generated by Phase 3. For each original sentence and its corresponding list of identified **IU(s)**:

1.  **Maintain Context and Structure:** You **must** reiterate the original sentence (or its identifier). Then, for each of its **IU(s)**, present the unit text followed by its classification(s).
2.  **Classify Each Information Unit (IU):** For every individual **"Information Unit" (IU)** provided by Phase 3:
    * Present the exact text of the **IU**.
    * Carefully evaluate the **IU** against each of the 12 categories and their full definitions (Scope, Primary IMRaD Location, Verification Notes) as detailed in the dedicated **Classification System for Information Units (IU)** section.
    * Assign **all applicable categories** that accurately describe the information conveyed by that **IU**.

**Example of Output Structure for Phase 4 (processing the output of Phase 3 for one sentence):**

**Processing Sentence X:** "The new method is effective, reduces costs significantly, though further validation is required."

*(Assuming Phase 3 produced:)*
* *IU 1:* "The new method is effective"
* *IU 2:* "reduces costs significantly"
* *IU 3:* "though further validation is required"

*(Then Phase 4 output for IUs from Sentence X would be):*

* **IU 1:** "The new method is effective"
    * **Classification(s):** Key Finding / Main Result
* **IU 2:** "reduces costs significantly"
    * **Classification(s):** Key Finding / Main Result
* **IU 3:** "though further validation is required"
    * **Classification(s):** Acknowledgement of Study Limitation(s); Suggestion for Future Research

##### **Phase 5: Referencing and Verification of Information Units (IU)**

**(This phase takes each classified Information Unit (IU) from Phase 4 and attempts to find its first substantiation or introduction in the main body of the manuscript: Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion (IMRaD sections).)**

**Goal:**
For every **Information Unit (IU)** identified and classified in the preceding phases, your objective is to:
1.  Locate the **first instance** in the main IMRaD sections of the manuscript (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion) where the core information of that **IU** was introduced, detailed, or substantiated.
2.  Provide clear evidence from that location.
3.  Explicitly identify if the **IU** from the 'Conclusions' appears to introduce **new substantive information** not found in the IMRaD sections, or if it cannot be substantiated by them. This is crucial for the quality check.

**Procedure:**
You will process the output generated by Phase 4. For each original sentence from the 'Conclusions' and its corresponding list of classified **IU(s)**:

1.  **Display Context:** For clarity, you **must reiterate the full original sentence, the specific IU text, and its assigned Classification(s)** from Phase 4. This provides complete context for the verification finding.
2.  **Determine Verification Strategy based on Classification:**
    * For the current **IU**, consult its assigned Classification(s).
    * Refer to the **"Classification System for Information Units (IU)"**. Specifically, use the **"Primary IMRaD Location for First Introduction/Substantiation"** to guide your primary search focus within the manuscript's IMRaD sections.
    * Also, consider the **"Verification Notes for Conclusions"** associated with the classification.
3.  **Search Main Manuscript Body (IMRaD Sections):**
    * Systematically search the **Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion** sections of the full manuscript for relevant passages. **Do not consider the 'Conclusions' section itself or the Abstract as primary sources for *first* substantiation.**
    * Your aim is to find the **earliest specific passage(s)** that introduce, detail, or substantiate the core assertion, data, or idea presented in the **IU**. Note all potentially relevant passages.
    * Focus on semantic equivalence and factual correspondence.
4.  **Evaluate Numeric Quantities (If the IU contains them):**
    * Based on the passages identified in Step 3, specifically examine any numeric quantities within the current **IU**.
    * **Apply the following rules for numeric verification:**
        * The **exact numeric value** mentioned in the **IU** (or a clearly equivalent textual representation) should ideally be explicitly present in the text of the IMRaD sections.
        * If the **IU's** numeric quantity is **derived** (e.g., a sum, average, or percentage calculated from multiple numbers presented in a table or text) but the derived number itself is **not explicitly stated** in the IMRaD text, this specific quantity should be considered "New Information" for the purpose of reporting in Step 5, even if the raw data for calculation exists.
        * **Rounding:** If the **IU** presents a rounded number (e.g., "~50," "approximately 100 mg"), it can be considered substantiated if a precise number from the IMRaD text reasonably rounds to it (e.g., IMRaD has "49.7" or "52"; Conclusion has "~50"). The precise number found in IMRaD should be noted for the "Evidence" in Step 5. If the rounding seems potentially misleading, significantly alters interpretation (e.g., Conclusion states "~90%" but IMRaD has "75%" or "99.7%"), or if multiple disparate precise numbers could be the source, this ambiguity must be noted in Step 5.
    * **Outcome of this step:** Determine for each numeric quantity if it is (a) an exact match, (b) a reasonable rounding, (c) a derived value not explicitly stated, or (d) not found/misleadingly rounded. This outcome will inform Step 5.
5.  **Report Verification Findings for Each Information Unit (IU):**
    * Synthesize the findings from Step 3 (general search) and Step 4 (numeric quantity evaluation) to determine the overall status and details for the **IU**.
    * Present your findings under a "Verification:" heading with the following structure:

    * **A. If Supporting Evidence is Found in IMRaD sections:**
        * **Status:** Substantiated. (This status may be qualified as "Partially Substantiated" if, for instance, a numeric quantity has rounding issues as noted in Step 4, or if only part of a complex IU is substantiated).
        * **First Appearance Location:** Specify the IMRaD section and, if possible, a more precise location (e.g., subsection title, figure/table reference if the text refers to it, or paragraph context).
        * **Evidence from Source:** Provide a brief, **direct quotation** from the identified location in the manuscript that clearly supports or introduces the information in the **IU**. If a numeric quantity was rounded, include the precise number from the source in or alongside the quote.
        * **Match Quality:** Briefly describe how well the evidence matches the **IU** (e.g., "Direct statement," "Exact numeric match," "Reasonable rounding of [precise value from IMRaD text]," "Strongly implied by this passage," "Paraphrases core idea"). Note any ambiguities from the numeric evaluation (Step 4) here.

    * **B. If No Clear Prior Substantiation is Found in IMRaD sections:**
        * **Status:** New Information in Conclusions (or Unsubstantiated).
        * **Note:** Provide a brief explanation. This should incorporate findings from Step 4 if a numeric quantity was deemed new or unstated. Examples:
            * "No specific prior statement or data directly substantiating this **IU** was found in the IMRaD sections. This information appears to be first introduced in the Conclusions."
            * (For numeric quantities): "The numeric value [X] from the **IU** was not explicitly stated in the IMRaD sections, though underlying data for its potential calculation may exist in Table Y."
            * "While related concepts are discussed in [Section X], this specific detail/claim appears novel to the Conclusions."

    * **C. If the Information Unit (IU) is inherently summative:**
        * **Status:** Summative Statement.
        * **Note:** Explain that the **IU** synthesizes previously substantiated findings/interpretations. Verification means confirming it's a *fair and accurate summary* of information detailed earlier in Results and Discussion. (e.g., "This remark accurately synthesizes key findings from Results and interpretations from Discussion previously reported.").

##### **Phase 6: Linguistic Flow and Pronoun Reference Analysis**

**(This phase analyzes the sentences of the 'Conclusions' section for vague/ambiguous pronoun references and, optionally, other issues affecting logical flow.)**

**Goal:**
To meticulously analyze the sentences of the 'Conclusions' section (as extracted by Phase 2) in sequence to:
1.  Identify any pronouns (especially demonstrative pronouns like "this," "that," and personal pronouns like "it," "they" when used to refer to earlier concepts or entities) whose antecedents are vague, ambiguous, or insufficiently specified *strictly within the textual context of the 'Conclusions' section itself*.
2.  Assess aspects of linguistic flow between sentences.

**Procedure:**
You will go through each sentence of the 'Conclusions' section one at a time, in the order they were extracted by Phase 2. For each sentence:

1.  **Quote the Current Sentence:** Clearly display the full original sentence being processed (e.g., "Processing Sentence [N]: [Full Sentence Text]").

2.  **Pronoun Reference Analysis:**
    * Identify all candidate pronouns in the current sentence that refer back to previously mentioned concepts or entities (focus on demonstrative pronouns like "this," "that," "these," "those" when used pronominally, and personal pronouns like "it," "they").
    * For each candidate pronoun, apply the following **strict constraints** to determine if it is vague or ambiguous:

        * **(Constraint 1) Antecedent Location:** The antecedent (the specific word(s), phrase(s), or concept the pronoun refers to) **MUST** be explicitly present as text within the 'Conclusions' section and **MUST** appear *before* the pronoun in question.
        * **(Constraint 2) Determiners vs. Pronouns:** A determiner (e.g., "this," "that," "these," "those") modifying a closely following noun (e.g., "this paper," "these results," "this work") should generally **not** be flagged as inherently vague for the purpose of this analysis if the resulting noun phrase has a clear and standard meaning in the context of a conclusions section. The primary focus is on pronouns standing more independently or referring to broader concepts. Relative pronouns (like "which," "who," "that" introducing a dependent clause) that have clear, immediate grammatical antecedents within the same sentence are also generally not the target unless their antecedent itself is part of a vague construction.
        * **(Constraint 3) Context for Antecedent Identification:** The context for identifying an antecedent is **strictly limited** to:
            * The sentence in which the pronoun appears.
            * The explicit text of the sentences that precede the pronoun *within the 'Conclusions' section only*.
        * **(Constraint 4) Sufficiency of Antecedent for Clarity (Crucial Rule):**
            * For a pronoun to be considered **not vague or ambiguous**, its identified antecedent (from the strictly defined preceding text within the 'Conclusions' section) must **explicitly and fully support all aspects of the statement in which the pronoun is used.**
            * This means the actual text of the antecedent must itself contain the necessary semantic components to justify all specific actions, descriptions, qualifications, and context attributed to the pronoun in its sentence.
            * **If the antecedent provides only general support, but the sentence containing the pronoun introduces more specific qualifications, actions, or context that are not explicitly covered by the antecedent's text, then the pronoun MUST be flagged as vague or its reference deemed incompletely supported by the local textual antecedent.**
            * No information from outside the 'Conclusions' section (e.g., from the main body of the paper) may be used to bridge semantic gaps between the pronoun's usage and its textual antecedent.

    * **Reporting for Pronoun Analysis:**
        * If no pronouns requiring this detailed antecedent analysis are identified in the sentence, state this briefly (e.g., "No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence.").
        * For each pronoun analyzed:
            * State the pronoun.
            * **Vagueness/Ambiguity Analysis:** Based on the constraints above, detail your reasoning. If an antecedent is considered, state what it is. If the pronoun is flagged, explain precisely why.
            * **Conclusion:** State clearly whether the pronoun is "Not flagged as vague/ambiguous" or "Flagged as vague/ambiguous."
            * **(If Flagged) Inferability Note:** Briefly discuss the extent to which its intended meaning can (or cannot) be reasonably inferred *strictly from the preceding text within the 'Conclusions' section*.

3.  **Flow Analysis (Optional - Initial Consideration):**
    * After analyzing pronouns, briefly consider the transition from the *immediately preceding sentence* to the *current sentence*.
    * **Note on Flow:** If there is an obviously abrupt topic shift, a missing logical connector, or if the sentence structure is unusually convoluted in a way that obscures its connection to the previous statement, make a brief note. (e.g., "Flow Note: Transition from previous sentence is abrupt."). If the flow is smooth, no note is needed.

#### **Output Formatting Summary:**

* If no 'Conclusions' section is reliably identified from the full manuscript according to the strict title criteria in Phase 1: An informative message stating this and termination of the analysis.
* If a 'Conclusions' section *is* identified from the full manuscript, the analysis proceeds through all phases (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6). The final output will be a structured report. This report will begin with:
    1.  A statement of the identified heading for the 'Conclusions' section.
    2.  A heading (e.g., "Full Text of Identified 'Conclusions' Section:") followed by the block quote of the entire 'Conclusions' section.
    3.  A heading (e.g., "Extracted Sentences from Conclusions:") followed by the list of sentences.
* Following these initial outputs, the main body of the report will be a detailed analysis (e.g., under a heading like "Detailed IU Analysis and Verification (Phases 3-5):"). This will iterate through each sentence originally extracted from the 'Conclusions' section. For each original sentence, the output will show:
    1.  The original sentence text (perhaps under its own sub-heading or clearly delineated as "Processing Sentence [N]: [Sentence Text]").
    2.  A numbered sub-list of the **"Information Unit(s)" (IU)** derived from that sentence during Phase 3. For each **IU** in this sub-list:
        * The exact text of the **IU**.
        * The "Classification(s)" assigned to that **IU** during Phase 4, listed clearly.
        * The "Verification:" details (Status, First Appearance Location, Evidence from Source, and Match Quality/Note) as produced by Phase 5.
* After the detailed IU analysis for all sentences, a new section for Phase 6 results will be presented (e.g., under a heading like "Linguistic Flow and Pronoun Reference Analysis (Phase 6):"). This section will iterate through each sentence from the 'Conclusions' section again:
    1.  "Processing Sentence [N]: [Full text of sentence]"
    2.  Pronoun Reference Analysis findings (as detailed in Phase 6).
    3.  Flow Analysis note (if applicable, as detailed in Phase 6).
* **All textual output generated by you (including headings, messages, quoted sections, lists, sub-lists, classifications, verification details, and linguistic analysis) should be formatted using clear and appropriate Markdown.** For instance, use `##` or `###` for major headings you generate for sections of your output, `####` or `#####` for sub-headings, blockquotes (`>`) for the full quoted 'Conclusions' section, and standard Markdown numbered lists.
