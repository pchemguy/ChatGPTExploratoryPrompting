This classification is good. Splitting should probably should be a dedicated phase though, after which the phases of classification and, later, verification, can be implemented.

First, I am going to give you my early prompts and respective outcomes. The prompts are very basic, this is the part we are working on. But the results - the splitting part and it presentation was fairly robust, I think. Whenever more than one chunk is identified for a sentence, chunks will be placed as a sublist under the source sentence. Exact quotation is still important, but the chunks will always be kept and processed together with the parent sentence, so the standalone requirement can be partially relaxed. Generally, I still do not want excessive chunking though. Let's take a look at reference examples.

# Prompt

Now, I want you to go through each point one at a time, identify every quantity or non-numeric fact stated about performed research, and find exact location in the experimental or discussion section where such quantity or fact appears for the first time. If you cannot find such a place for a particular quantity or non-numeric fact, clearly indicate so.

# Response

Okay, I will go through each point from the Conclusions section, identify the quantities or non-numeric facts about the performed research, and locate their first appearance in the Experimental or Results and Discussion sections.

### **Analysis of Conclusion Points**

Here's the breakdown:

**Point 1:** "An inexpensive, straightforward method for enriching 17O-labeled water from tap water and the subsequent preparation of 17O-labeled hydrogen peroxide from electrolysis of H217​O are described in this paper."

- **Fact 1a:** An inexpensive, straightforward method for enriching 17O-labeled water from tap water is described.
    - **First Appearance (Method Description):** Experimental Section, "Enrichment of H217​O from Tap Water.". The "inexpensive" nature is implied by the simple setup (windowsill evaporation, basic distillation). The "straightforward" nature is implied by the description of the steps.
        
    - The explicit claim of it being "inexpensive" is stated in the introduction: "In this paper we describe an inexpensive method for enriching both H217​O and H218​O in tap water...". While the conclusion claims it's "described in this paper", the _first description of the method itself_ is in the Experimental section.
        
- **Fact 1b:** The subsequent preparation of 17O-labeled hydrogen peroxide from electrolysis of H217​O is described.
    - **First Appearance (Method Description):** Experimental Section, "Preparation of Hydrogen Peroxide by the Electrolysis of Water.".
        

---

**Point 2:** "The fractional distillation method for enrichment of H217​O reported here can greatly enrich the percentage of H217​O or H218​O which are both useful for isotope studies."

- **Fact 2a:** The fractional distillation method for enrichment of H217​O reported here can greatly enrich the percentage of H217​O.
    - **First Appearance (Method Description):** Experimental Section, "Fractional Distillation of the Enriched Water.".
        
    - **First Appearance (Extent of Enrichment - Result):** Results and Discussion, Table 1 shows high percentages of 17O in distilled fractions (e.g., fraction #5: 99.1% 17O; fraction #11: 99.7% 17O). The text states, "The higher the boiling point of a fraction, the higher the 17O content in the distillate.".
        
- **Fact 2b:** The fractional distillation method... can greatly enrich... H218​O.
    - **First Appearance (Extent of Enrichment - Result):** Results and Discussion, Table 1 shows enrichment of 18O in the residue (57.3% 18O). The text states, "As expected, the residue contained a high percentage of H218​O.".
        
- **Fact 2c:** ...which are both useful for isotope studies.
    - **First Appearance (Context/Justification):** This is a general statement of utility. The introduction discusses the utility of 17O for NMR and the high cost of commercial H217​O, implying usefulness. The experimental goals (studying P450cam, preparing various labeled compounds) also point to this utility. No single sentence in Experimental or Results/Discussion _first_ states this general utility in these exact words for _both_ isotopes in the context of their enrichment method. The introduction mentions the need for an economical method for 17O-labeling studies.
        

---

**Point 3:** "From approximately 500 mL of 40-fold enriched water, about 90 mL of H217​O was obtained."

- **Fact 3a:** Starting material: approximately 500 mL of 40-fold enriched water.
    - **First Appearance (Quantity for Distillation):** Experimental Section, "Fractional Distillation of the Enriched Water," states "~500 mL of this was placed in a 1 L round-bottom flask... for fractional distillation.".
        
    - **First Appearance ("40-fold enriched"):** This specific term "40-fold enriched water" as the starting material for the 500 mL distillation is stated in the Conclusion section itself. The abstract mentions "enriched from 0.04% to ~90%," but not the "40-fold" intermediate stage linked to the 500 mL. The Experimental section describes accumulation of ">1 L of enriched water" from the evaporation step, but doesn't quantify its enrichment level as "40-fold" prior to taking 500 mL for distillation. Therefore, the "40-fold enriched" characterization of the 500 mL _first appears in this conclusive statement_.
        
- **Fact 3b:** Yield: about 90 mL of H217​O was obtained.
    - **First Appearance:** This specific yield "about 90 mL" from the 500 mL distillation run is stated in the Conclusion section. The Experimental section details collection of specific fractions: "Fractions having boiling points of 98.5 °C (10 mL x 6) and 99 °C (10 mL) were collected", totaling 70 mL. Table 1 reports "approx. vol (mL)" for fraction #5 as 60 mL and for fraction #11 as 10 mL, also summing to 70 mL of highly enriched water. The "about 90 mL" figure for the total obtained H217​O appears to be a summary figure _first stated in the Conclusions_. It might combine fractions or refer to a typical total yield not explicitly broken down this way earlier.
        

---

**Point 4:** "The most practical method for determining the enrichment was found to be the reaction of the H217​O with BSTFA to yield hexamethyldisiloxane which was quantified by GC-MS analysis."

- **Fact 4a:** The most practical method for determining enrichment was reaction of H217​O with BSTFA to yield hexamethyldisiloxane.
    - **First Appearance (Method Description):** Experimental Section, "Synthesis of Labeled 1-Hexanol and Hexamethyldisiloxane," describes the reaction: "To form hexamethyldisiloxane, HMDS (or bis-trimethylsilyl oxide) (Scheme 2), 0.5μL of deionized water and H217​O were each treated with 5μL of BSTFA for 40 min at 60 °C.".
        
    - The assertion that this is "the most practical method" is a judgment. The abstract mentions GC-MS of hexanol and HMDS to determine enrichment. The Results and Discussion section details this method under "Determination of the Percentage of H217​O in the Fractions from Distillation" and presents the HMDS approach alongside the hexanol method. The _explicit claim_ of it being "most practical" is first made in the Conclusions.
        
- **Fact 4b:** ...which was quantified by GC-MS analysis.
    - **First Appearance (Method Description):** Experimental Section, "For HMDS GC-MS analysis, ion storage (SIS mode) was used, and m/z 135-150 amu was scanned.".
        
    - **First Appearance (Quantification Details - Result):** Results and Discussion, under "Determination of the Percentage of H217​O in the Fractions from Distillation," calculations for HMDS are shown and results presented in Table 1.
        

---

**Point 5:** "Five other 17O-labeled compounds were also prepared from the 17O-labeled water (sodium hydroxide, 1-hexanol, hydrogen peroxide, trimethylsilanol, and camphor) and characterized by NMR and GC-MS."

- **Fact 5a:** Five other 17O-labeled compounds were also prepared from the 17O-labeled water.
    - The list is: sodium hydroxide, 1-hexanol, hydrogen peroxide, trimethylsilanol, and camphor.
    - **Sodium Hydroxide (Na17OH):**
        - **First Appearance (Preparation):** Experimental Section, "Synthesis of Labeled 1-Hexanol..." implies formation of Na17OH as an intermediate: "17O-Labeled hexanol was synthesized by reacting the 17O enriched water with sodium metal, followed by addition of 1-iodohexane. Briefly, 200μL (0.2 mmol) of 17O water was reacted with 3 mg (0.13 mmol) of sodium metal (Scheme 1).". Scheme 1 explicitly shows 2Na+2H217​O→2Na17OH+H2​.
            
    - **1-Hexanol (17O 1-hexanol):**
        - **First Appearance (Preparation):** Experimental Section, "Synthesis of Labeled 1-Hexanol and Hexamethyldisiloxane.".
            
    - **Hydrogen Peroxide (H217​O2​):**
        - **First Appearance (Preparation):** Experimental Section, "Preparation of Hydrogen Peroxide by the Electrolysis of Water.". (The abstract also mentions this ).
            
    - **Trimethylsilanol (17O-labeled trimethylsilanol):**
        - **First Appearance (Preparation):** Experimental Section, implied in the HMDS synthesis for NMR: "In our NMR studies, 17O-labeled trimethylsilanol, 17O-labeled hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDS), and 17O-labeled trifluoroacetamide (reaction byproduct) were detected.". Scheme 2 shows hydrolysis of BSTFA by H2​O to form HMDS, which implies trimethylsilanol as an intermediate before condensation to HMDS. Direct preparation isn't detailed as a separate goal but as a detected species.
            
    - **Camphor (17O-Camphor):**
        - **First Appearance (Preparation):** Experimental Section, "Preparation of 17O Camphor.". (The abstract also mentions this ).
            
- **Fact 5b:** ...and characterized by NMR and GC-MS.
    - **Sodium Hydroxide:**
        - NMR: Results and Discussion, "17O NMR. Sodium Hydroxide..." "The 17O chemical shift of labeled sodium hydroxide (~0.5 M) was 8.8 ppm (Figure 2a).".
            
        - GC-MS: Not typically applicable for NaOH. Not mentioned.
    - **1-Hexanol:**
        - NMR: Results and Discussion, "17O NMR. ...Hexanol..." "The chemical shifts of other 17O-labeled compounds were -4.16 ppm for 117O hexanol (Figure 2b)...". Proton and Carbon NMR also mentioned in Results and Discussion, "Effects of 17O on the 1H and 13C Chemical Shifts in Hexanol and Camphor. 1-Hexanol.".
            
        - GC-MS: Experimental Section, describing monitoring of synthesis and analysis of product. Results and Discussion, "Determination of the Percentage of H217​O in the Fractions from Distillation" details its use for enrichment determination.
            
    - **Hydrogen Peroxide:**
        - NMR: Results and Discussion, "17O NMR. ...Hydrogen Peroxide." "The hydrogen peroxide had an 17O chemical shift of 179 ppm (Figure 4)...".
            
        - GC-MS: Not mentioned for H2​O2​ characterization. Quantitation was by colorimetric assays.
            
    - **Trimethylsilanol:**
        - NMR: Results and Discussion, "17O NMR. ...HMDS, Trimethylsilanol..." "...17.7 ppm for trimethylsilanol (Figure 2c)...". Proton and Carbon NMR of HMDS and trimethylsilanol mixture is mentioned in SI Figure S8, S9 descriptions.
            
        - GC-MS: The synthesis of HMDS from BSTFA and water for GC-MS analysis is described. Trimethylsilanol is a likely intermediate or co-product here too, though HMDS is the target for this GC-MS analysis.
            
    - **Camphor:**
        - NMR: Results and Discussion, "17O NMR. ...Camphor." "The 17O chemical shift of this camphor solution dissolved in CDCl3​ was 502.4 ppm (Figure 3a) (Scheme 5).". Proton and Carbon NMR also mentioned in Results and Discussion, "Effects of 17O on the 1H and 13C Chemical Shifts in Hexanol and Camphor. Camphor.".
            
        - GC-MS: Experimental Section, "After NMR, a sample was extracted and checked by EI GC-MS (The GC-MS data of 17O-labeled camphor is included in the Supporting Information).".
            

---

**Point 6:** "This illustrates the power of 17O NMR in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups."

- **Fact 6a:** This (referring to the body of work, particularly the detection of the unexpected exchange reaction mentioned next, and characterization of labeled compounds) illustrates the power of 17O NMR in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups.
    - **First Appearance (as a concluding remark/illustration):** This specific concluding sentence appears first in the Conclusions. However, the _concept_ is built up. The abstract states: "This is an example of the usefulness of 17O NMR in the study of a reaction mechanism that has not been noticed previously.". The introduction mentions: "...17O chemical shifts span a range... making distinguishing functional groups... relatively straightforward... making it a practical tool for mechanistic studies.". The discussion of the camphor/ethanol/cyclohexanone exchange reactions heavily relies on 17O NMR evidence to detect and propose mechanisms. For instance, "This suggests that labeled ethanol formation can occur due to its exchange with H217​O and also when ethanol attacks the keto group of 17O-labeled camphor..." is an observation derived from 17O NMR.
        

---

**Point 7:** "Finally, an unexpected exchange reaction of primary alcohol moieties with water, facilitated by ketones, was detected by 17O NMR."

- **Fact 7a:** An unexpected exchange reaction of primary alcohol moieties with water... was detected by 17O NMR.
    - **First Appearance (Observation):** Results and Discussion, "Camphor." subsection. After observing 17O labeled ethanol when camphor was dissolved in ethanol with H217​O: "The camphor peak seemed to be small, and surprisingly an intense peak at 11 ppm (Figure 3b) was also observed which corresponds to 17O labeled ethanol.". This is the first mention of the _detection_ of this labeling.
        
- **Fact 7b:** ...facilitated by ketones.
    - **First Appearance (Hypothesis/Observation):** Results and Discussion, comparing camphor and cyclohexanone: "...suggesting that camphor catalyzes the exchange of the ethanol OH group more effectively than cyclohexanone.". And later, "Thus, the carbonyl exchange reaction is potentially useful for the labeling of compounds, but it also needs to be taken into account when studying metabolic pathways by oxygen labeling.". The abstract also states: "...we also detected an unexpected oxygen exchange reaction of primary alcohols, catalyzed by electrophilic ketones such as camphor.".
        

This detailed cross-referencing should cover all the quantities and non-numeric facts stated in the conclusions regarding the performed research.

#### **Role:**

You are an **Expert Scientific Content Analyst and Editor**. Your expertise lies in meticulously reviewing the main body (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion - IMRaD) of academic manuscripts to identify the most salient information suitable for a 'Conclusions' section. You are also skilled in synthesizing these curated insights into well-structured, concise, and impactful draft 'Conclusions' sections.

#### **Context:**

You will be provided with the full text of the **IMRaD sections (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion)** of an academic manuscript. **You MUST completely ignore any Abstract or Conclusions sections if they are present in the provided text.** Your analysis and drafting are to be based *solely* on the IMRaD content.

Your overall goal is a two-phase process:
1.  First, to identify critical pieces of information from the IMRaD sections that are "conclusion-worthy."
2.  Second, to use these selected and annotated pieces of information to construct one or more draft 'Conclusions' sections.

You will use the **"Classification System for Information Units"** (defined immediately below) to guide your analysis in Phase 1.

#### **Classification System for Information Units**

(This section defines the 12 categories used to assess content from IMRaD. Each category includes its Scope, typical Primary IMRaD Location for original substantiation, and Verification Notes which, for this task, help understand the *nature* of information that belongs in a conclusion for that category.)

    * **Verification Notes for Conclusions:** The full description of the highlighted method must exist in the Methods section. If its effectiveness or novelty is part of the highlight, supporting data/evidence should be present in the Results section.

5.  **Interpretation of Finding(s):**
    * **Scope:** Information Units explaining the meaning or implications of the study's results within its specific context, often connecting findings or exploring reasons for outcomes.
    * **Primary IMRaD Location for First Introduction/Substantiation:** Discussion
    * **Verification Notes for Conclusions:** Ensure these interpretations are consistent with, and concisely summarize, more detailed interpretations and arguments already presented in the Discussion section, which must be grounded in the Results.

    * **Primary IMRaD Location for First Introduction/Substantiation:** Content derived from Results and Discussion; specific phrasing is unique to Conclusions.
    * **Verification Notes for Conclusions:** The take-home message must be a fair and accurate representation of the study's main, substantiated contributions detailed elsewhere (primarily Results and Discussion) and should not introduce new substantive claims.

#### **Task:**

You will perform a two-phase analysis and generation task. First, you will identify and evaluate conclusion-worthy information from the IMRaD sections. Second, you will use this curated information to draft a 'Conclusions' section.

##### **Phase 1: Identification and Evaluation of Conclusion-Worthy Content from IMRaD**

For **each** of the 12 "Information Categories" defined in the **"Classification System for Information Units"** section above, you will perform the following 4-step process:

1.  **Understand the Current Category:**
    * Carefully review the **Scope**, **Primary IMRaD Location**, and **Verification Notes** for the specific Information Category you are currently analyzing. This will guide your search and evaluation.

2.  **Scan IMRaD Sections for Relevant Content:**
    * Systematically scan the provided Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion sections.
    * Focus your search primarily on the "Primary IMRaD Location" indicated for the category, but remain open to finding highly relevant information in other IMRaD sections if its nature strongly aligns with the category's scope.
    * Identify passages, sentences, or key phrases that are strong examples of the type of information described by the current category's "Scope."

3.  **Select Top Candidate Quotes (Up to 3):**
    * From the relevant content identified in Step 2, select **up to three (3)** direct quotes that are the most compelling, representative, and impactful examples for the current Information Category.
    * These quotes should be **exact fragments** from the IMRaD text. Aim for conciseness where possible, but ensure the quote is self-standing enough to convey the core piece of information.
    * **Selection Criteria for "Best" Candidates:** If you find many potential quotes, prioritize those that are:
        * Most directly and explicitly aligned with the category's scope.
        * Most significant to the overall narrative and contribution of the paper.
        * Clear, unambiguous, and impactful.
    * If you find no strong candidates in the IMRaD sections for the current category, explicitly state: "No strong candidate quotes found in IMRaD for this category." and proceed to the next category.

4.  **Evaluate Selected Candidate Quotes and Determine Final Output Eligibility:**
    * For each selected candidate quote (from Step 3, if any):
        * **a. Candidate Quote:** Present the direct quote.
        * **b. Source Location:** Specify its precise location within the IMRaD sections (e.g., "Results, Subsection 'Statistical Analysis', paragraph 2," or "Discussion, page X, paragraph Y").
        * **c. Evaluation of Candidate in IMRaD Context:** Briefly explain why this quote is a strong exemplar of the Information Category, considering its role and importance within the IMRaD section it came from. (e.g., "This statement from the Results section directly presents the primary statistical outcome that addresses the main hypothesis.").
        * **d. Assessment of Suitability for Conclusions:** Critically evaluate whether this specific piece of information (as represented by the quote) "truly deserves" or "stands out" as an element that should typically be included, summarized, or reiterated in a 'Conclusions' section. Consider factors such as:
            * Its direct relevance to answering the main research question(s) or achieving key objectives.
            * Its overall impact, novelty, or importance.
            * Its necessity for providing a balanced and comprehensive summary of the study's outcomes and implications.
            * Whether it's a core take-away message for the reader.
            * (Your assessment here should result in a clear rating, e.g., "Highly Suitable," "Moderately Suitable," or "Less Suitable").
        * **e. Justification for Suitability:** Provide a brief justification for your assessment (e.g., "Highly Suitable: This is the central finding of the paper and must be in the conclusions." or "Moderately Suitable: This limitation is important for context but might be too detailed for a concise conclusion; a more general summary of limitations might be better." or "Less Suitable: While a valid methodological detail, it's likely too specific for a general conclusions section.").

    * **Filtering for Phase 2 Input:** After evaluating all selected candidates for the current Information Category, **only those candidates assessed as "Highly Suitable" or "Moderately Suitable" will be used as input for Phase 2.** Make an internal note of these filtered candidates and their annotations for use in Phase 2. The output for Phase 1 (described in "Output Formatting") will list these filtered candidates.

##### **Phase 2: Generation of Draft 'Conclusions' Section(s)**

**Input for this Phase:** You will use the curated list of 'Conclusion-Worthy Information Units' (i.e., the candidate quotes from IMRaD assessed as "Highly Suitable" or "Moderately Suitable" in Phase 1), along with their original category, source location, evaluation, and justification, as your sole source material for drafting the conclusions.

**Goal for this Phase:** To synthesize these approved units into one or more coherent, concise, and well-written draft 'Conclusions' sections, adhering to the specified constraints and guidelines.

**Key Instructions for Drafting:**

1.  **Overall Comprehension:** Before drafting, review all provided 'Conclusion-Worthy Information Units' and their annotations from Phase 1 to fully grasp the main story, key outcomes, and overall message of the research.
2.  **Structure and Logical Flow:** Plan a logical structure for the 'Conclusions' draft. A common and effective flow involves:
    * Opening with a clear restatement of the main finding(s), answer(s) to the research question, or the study's primary achievement (often drawing from input units categorized as 'Key Finding / Main Result,' 'Answer to Research Question / Resolution of Hypothesis,' or sometimes a pivotal 'Reiteration of Study Aim/Problem' followed by its resolution).
    * Elaborating with significant interpretations, broader implications, and practical applications (drawing from 'Interpretation of Finding(s),' 'Statement of Broader Significance / Impact,' 'Practical Application / Recommendation').
    * Briefly contextualizing with literature comparisons if highly relevant and provided as a suitable unit (from 'Comparison with Existing Literature / Contextualization').
    * Acknowledging key limitations (from 'Acknowledgement of Study Limitation(s)').
    * Concluding with suggestions for future research or a final, impactful take-home message (from 'Suggestion for Future Research / Outlook,' 'Overall Concluding Remark / Take-Home Message').
    You are not required to include content from every category; use only the "Highly Suitable" or "Moderately Suitable" information units provided from Phase 1. Use the original category of the input units to guide their placement and role in the draft.
3.  **Synthesis and Paraphrasing:** Your primary task is to **synthesize and paraphrase** the information from the provided units into a flowing narrative. The 'Conclusions' section should be written in **fresh, concise language** suitable for a summary. **Avoid directly copying extensive phrases or full sentences from the input quotes**; the aim is original composition based on their informational content, maintaining the original meaning.
4.  **Accuracy and Fidelity:** Ensure your paraphrasing **accurately reflects the original meaning, nuance, and claims** of the provided information units. Do not introduce new interpretations, data, or information not present in or directly supported by these input units.
5.  **Utilizing Annotations from Phase 1:** Subtly leverage the 'Justification for Suitability' and 'Evaluation of Candidate in IMRaD Context' annotations provided with each input unit. These can help you understand the significance of each piece and how to emphasize or frame it within the draft.
6.  **Cohesion and Transitions:** Employ appropriate transition words and phrases (e.g., 'Furthermore,' 'However,' 'In addition,' 'Therefore,' 'These findings suggest...') to ensure smooth logical connections between different statements and ideas, creating a cohesive narrative.
7.  **Conciseness and Word Count:** The draft 'Conclusions' section should be concise. Aim for a total word count of approximately **250-350 words** (unless a different range is specified by the user). Focus on conveying the essence of each essential unit.
8.  **Avoiding Redundancy:** If multiple provided information units convey very similar ideas, synthesize their core message into a single, more comprehensive statement to avoid unnecessary repetition in the draft.
9.  **Tone:** Maintain a formal, objective, and scholarly tone throughout the 'Conclusions' draft. Be assertive when stating key findings and their significance, but ensure limitations are presented fairly and constructively.
10. **Alternative Draft (Optional):** After generating the primary draft, if you identify a significantly different but equally valid way to structure or emphasize the key points, you may provide **one concise alternative draft** (also adhering to the word count).

#### **Output Formatting:**

* **A. Phase 1 Output: Identified Conclusion-Worthy Content**
    * Organize this part of your output clearly by the 12 Information Categories.
    * For each Information Category, provide a main heading (e.g., `### 1. Reiteration of Study Aim/Problem`).
    * Under each category heading:
        * If candidate quotes were found *and deemed "Highly Suitable" or "Moderately Suitable"* for inclusion in conclusions (as per Task Phase 1, Step 4), list each such quote. For each quote, provide its:
            * **Candidate Quote:** [The direct quote]
            * **Source Location:** [e.g., "Results, Subsection 'Statistical Analysis', paragraph 2"]
            * **Evaluation of Candidate in IMRaD Context:** [Your brief explanation]
            * **Assessment of Suitability for Conclusions:** ["Highly Suitable" or "Moderately Suitable"]
            * **Justification for Suitability:** [Your brief justification]
        * If no strong candidates were initially found in IMRaD for the category (as per Task Phase 1, Step 3), state: "No strong candidate quotes found in IMRaD for this category."
        * If candidates were found and evaluated, but *none* were deemed "Highly Suitable" or "Moderately Suitable" for inclusion in conclusions (as per Task Phase 1, Step 4 Filtering), state: "No candidate quotes for this category were deemed sufficiently suitable for inclusion in a 'Conclusions' section."

* **B. Phase 2 Output: Draft 'Conclusions' Section(s)**
    * Present this under a clear main heading (e.g., `## Draft Conclusions Section(s)`).
    * Clearly label each draft (e.g., "**Draft Conclusion 1**").
    * Provide the full text of the drafted 'Conclusions' section.
    * Indicate the approximate **Word Count:** for each draft.
    * If an alternative draft is provided, label it clearly (e.g., "**Alternative Draft Conclusion 2**") and also provide its word count.

* Use Markdown for clear structure (headings, subheadings, lists, bolding for labels like **Source Location:**).
