#### **Classification Categories for Conclusive Information Units:**

1. **Reiteration of Study Aim/Problem:**
    * **Scope:** Units that briefly restate the core research question(s), objective(s), hypothesis (or hypotheses), or the problem/gap the study was designed to address.
    - **Primary IMRaD Location for First Introduction/Substantiation:** **Introduction**
    - **Notes for Verification in Conclusions:** The 'Conclusions' may briefly restate the main question, objective, or problem to frame the study's outcomes. Verification should ensure this aligns with the detailed aims and scope presented in the Introduction.
2. **Key Finding / Main Result:**
    * **Scope:** Units stating a primary outcome, discovery, or observation that directly addresses the study's main aim(s) or research question(s).
    - **Primary IMRaD Location for First Introduction/Substantiation:** **Results**
    - **Notes for Verification in Conclusions:** Statements of key findings in the 'Conclusions' should be direct summaries or highlights of data, figures, tables, or factual statements presented in the Results section. New data points should not appear here.
3. **Subsidiary Finding / Secondary Result:**
    * **Scope:** Units stating a noteworthy outcome or observation not central to the main research question(s) but providing additional insight or supporting main findings.
    - **Primary IMRaD Location for First Introduction/Substantiation:** **Results**
    - **Notes for Verification in Conclusions:** Similar to key findings, any secondary or less central results mentioned in the 'Conclusions' must have been previously presented with supporting evidence in the Results section.
4. **Methodological Highlight (Pivotal Aspect):**
    * **Scope:** Units briefly highlighting a novel, critical, or relevant aspect of the study's methodology crucial for the results or as a contribution itself.
    - **Primary IMRaD Location for First Introduction/Substantiation:** **Methods** (for description) and potentially **Results** (if the "highlight" involves the performance or validation of the method).
    - **Notes for Verification in Conclusions:** If the 'Conclusions' emphasize a specific methodological aspect, that method should be fully detailed in the Methods section. If its effectiveness is highlighted, supporting data for this claim should be in the Results section.
5. **Interpretation of Finding(s):**
    * **Scope:** Units explaining the meaning or implications of results *within the study's context*, often connecting findings or explaining *why* a result might have occurred.
    - **Primary IMRaD Location for First Introduction/Substantiation:** **Discussion**
    - **Notes for Verification in Conclusions:** The 'Conclusions' may summarize key interpretations of what the results mean. These interpretations should be consistent with and derived from more detailed explanations and arguments presented in the Discussion section, which, in turn, must be grounded in the Results.
6. **Answer to Research Question / Resolution of Hypothesis:**
    * **Scope:** Units explicitly stating how findings answer initial research question(s) or address initial hypothesis (hypotheses).
    - **Primary IMRaD Location for First Introduction/Substantiation:** **Discussion**
    - **Notes for Verification in Conclusions:** The 'Conclusions' will typically offer a concise answer to the main research question(s) or state whether hypotheses were supported. This should reflect the detailed arguments, evidence, and reasoning laid out in the Discussion section.
7. **Comparison with Existing Literature / Contextualization:**
    * **Scope:** Units relating the study's findings to existing knowledge, theories, or previous research (e.g., consistency, contradiction, extension).
    - **Primary IMRaD Location for First Introduction/Substantiation:** Primarily **Discussion**; foundational context also in **Introduction**.
    - **Notes for Verification in Conclusions:** When the 'Conclusions' position the study's findings relative to existing literature, this should summarize more extensive comparisons, an exploration of consistencies/discrepancies, and contextualization found within the Discussion section. The Introduction also sets initial context.
8. **Statement of Broader Significance / Impact:**
    * **Scope:** Units articulating the wider importance, contribution, or value of the study's findings to the field or society.
    - **Primary IMRaD Location for First Introduction/Substantiation:** **Discussion**
    - **Notes for Verification in Conclusions:** Claims about the broader importance or impact of the study made in the 'Conclusions' should be logical extensions of the findings and interpretations, with the detailed arguments supporting this significance presented in the Discussion section.
9. **Practical Application / Recommendation:**
    * **Scope:** Units suggesting how findings could be applied in real-world settings, or making specific recommendations (e.g., for practice, policy).
    - **Primary IMRaD Location for First Introduction/Substantiation:** **Discussion**
    - **Notes for Verification in Conclusions:** Any practical applications or specific recommendations highlighted in the 'Conclusions' should stem from findings and interpretations, with the rationale and details more fully explored in the Discussion.
10. **Acknowledgement of Study Limitation(s):**
    * **Scope:** Units identifying constraints, weaknesses, caveats, or boundaries of the study.
    - **Primary IMRaD Location for First Introduction/Substantiation:** **Discussion** (most common), or sometimes a dedicated "Limitations" sub-section. Aspects of methodology limitations may also appear in **Methods**.
    - **Notes for Verification in Conclusions:** Limitations mentioned in the 'Conclusions' should be consistent with those already detailed and acknowledged in the Discussion or Methods section. It's generally not appropriate for a new, unmentioned limitation to first appear in the 'Conclusions'.
11. **Suggestion for Future Research / Outlook:**
    * **Scope:** Units proposing specific directions for subsequent studies, new questions, or areas needing further investigation; or a broader outlook.
    - **Primary IMRaD Location for First Introduction/Substantiation:** **Discussion**
    - **Notes for Verification in Conclusions:** Suggestions for future work or an outlook provided in the 'Conclusions' should logically arise from the current study's findings, interpretations, and limitations, and typically summarize more detailed suggestions made in the Discussion.
12. **Overall Concluding Remark / Take-Home Message:**
    * **Scope:** An Information Unit (often a full sentence when not further chunked, or a dominant clause) providing a final, high-level summary, encapsulating the main essence or core message.
    - **Primary IMRaD Location for First Introduction/Substantiation:** This is inherently a **summary statement unique to the 'Conclusions' section in its specific phrasing**, but its _content_ must be entirely derived from substantiated elements presented earlier, primarily from the **Results** (what was found) and **Discussion** (what it means, its significance, answers to RQs).
    - **Notes for Verification in Conclusions:** The take-home message must be a fair, accurate, and concise representation of the study's main, validated contributions and should not introduce any new information or claims. It's a final emphasis on what has already been established.


**General Principle for Verification:**

The fundamental rule for Phase 5 (Verification) will be that, with the exception of purely summative phrasing inherent to a "Concluding Remark," no _new substantive information_ (findings, interpretations, methods, limitations, etc.) should be introduced for the first time in the 'Conclusions' section. Each information unit from the 'Conclusions' should have a clear antecedent or basis in the preceding IMRaD sections.
