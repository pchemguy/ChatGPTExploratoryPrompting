#### **Classification System for Information Units (IU)**

(This section defines a system of 13 categories for classifying Information Units (IU). These categories describe distinct types of scholarly information that are typically found within, or are suitable for inclusion in, summary sections of an academic manuscript, such as an Abstract or a Conclusions section. All such information is understood to originate from, and be substantiated by, the main IMRaD (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion) content of the paper. Each category definition below includes:

- **Scope:** This primarily guides the **classification** of an Information Unit by defining the nature of the information it contains.
- **Primary IMRaD Location:** This indicates where the detailed, original information is typically first presented in the main paper, guiding where to search for or verify such information.
- **Verification Notes:** These notes provide criteria for assessing the integrity, appropriate sourcing, and faithful representation of an Information Unit when it appears in, or is being considered for, a summary section (such as an Abstract or a Conclusion). They help ensure that such summary elements accurately reflect the detailed IMRaD content and adhere to good scholarly practice (e.g., not introducing new data in a summary of findings, ensuring limitations are contextually appropriate if mentioned in a summary).)

1. **Background, Aim, and Problem Statement**
    - **Scope:** Information Units that establish brief background/context for the study, AND/OR state the core research question(s), objective(s), hypothesis (hypotheses), or the problem/gap the study was designed to address. (In an Abstract, this often forms the opening statements; in Conclusions, it's typically a focused reminder of the core purpose or problem).
    - **Primary IMRaD Location for First Introduction/Substantiation:** Introduction
    - **Verification Notes:** Verify that this accurately reflects, and does not misrepresent or unduly expand upon, the background, aims, objectives, and problem statement detailed in the Introduction section of the main paper.
2. **Statement of Core Methodology**
    - **Scope:** Information Units concisely describing the primary methods, key experimental design features, main apparatus, population/sample, or principal operational approach used in the study. (Essential for Abstracts; Conclusions would typically only mention methods if using Category 3).
    - **Primary IMRaD Location for First Introduction/Substantiation:** Methods
    - **Verification Notes:** Ensure this is a fair and accurate summary of the main methodologies detailed in the Methods section; it should not introduce methods not mentioned there nor go into excessive detail inappropriate for a summary.
3. **Methodological Highlight (Pivotal Aspect)**
    - **Scope:** Information Units briefly highlighting a novel, critical, or particularly relevant aspect of the study's methodology that was crucial for the results or represents a significant contribution in itself, often emphasizing _why_ it was pivotal or how it impacted the study. (More typical for Conclusions if a methodological point is a key takeaway).
    - **Primary IMRaD Location for First Introduction/Substantiation:** Methods (for full description); Results (for performance/validation data, if applicable).
    - **Verification Notes:** The full description of the highlighted method must exist in the Methods section. If its effectiveness or novelty is part of the highlight, supporting data/evidence should be present in the Results section.
4. **Key Finding / Main Result**
    - **Scope:** Information Units stating a primary outcome, discovery, or observation that directly addresses the study's main aim(s) or research question(s). (Abstracts will present these very concisely).
    - **Primary IMRaD Location for First Introduction/Substantiation:** Results
    - **Verification Notes:** Verify that these are direct statements or accurate summaries of data, figures, tables, or factual statements presented in the Results section. No new data or results should be introduced here that are not in the main paper's Results.
5. **Subsidiary Finding / Secondary Result**
    - **Scope:** Information Units stating a noteworthy outcome or observation not central to the main research question(s) but providing additional insight or supporting main findings. (Rare in Abstracts, more common in Conclusions if space and significance allow).
    - **Primary IMRaD Location for First Introduction/Substantiation:** Results
    - **Verification Notes:** Verify these were previously presented with supporting evidence in the Results section and are not new data points not found in the main paper's Results.
6. **Interpretation of Finding(s)**
    - **Scope:** Information Units explaining the meaning of the study's results, often connecting findings or exploring reasons for outcomes. (In an Abstract, interpretations are typically very concise and tied directly to key findings; Conclusions may offer slightly more elaborated summaries of interpretations).
    - **Primary IMRaD Location for First Introduction/Substantiation:** Discussion
    - **Verification Notes:** Ensure interpretations are consistent with, and (if in Conclusions) concisely summarize, more detailed interpretations in the Discussion, grounded in Results. Abstracts will offer very brief interpretations.
7. **Answer to Research Question / Resolution of Hypothesis**
    - **Scope:** Information Units explicitly stating how the study's findings answer the initial research question(s) or confirm/refute/modify the initial hypothesis (hypotheses). (In an Abstract, this is often a direct and concise statement).
    - **Primary IMRaD Location for First Introduction/Substantiation:** Discussion
    - **Verification Notes:** Verify this answer/resolution concisely reflects detailed arguments and evidence from the Discussion, which links to Results. Ensure no new claims are made beyond this.
8. **Comparison with Existing Literature / Contextualization**
    - **Scope:** Information Units relating the study's findings to existing knowledge, theories, or previous research, noting consistencies, contradictions, or extensions. (Generally rare and very brief in Abstracts; more common in Conclusions as a summary of key comparisons from the Discussion).
    - **Primary IMRaD Location for First Introduction/Substantiation:** Discussion (primarily for detailed comparisons); Introduction (for foundational context).
    - **Verification Notes:** Confirm statements summarize comparisons and contextualization already explored in the Discussion. Abstracts rarely contain this.
9. **Statement of Broader Significance / Impact**
    - **Scope:** Information Units articulating the wider importance, contribution, or potential value of the study's findings to its specific field or to society more generally. (A key component for both Abstracts and Conclusions).
    - **Primary IMRaD Location for First Introduction/Substantiation:** Discussion
    - **Verification Notes:** Check that these statements are logical extensions of findings and interpretations, with the detailed arguments supporting this significance in the Discussion.
10. **Practical Application / Recommendation**
    - **Scope:** Information Units suggesting how the study's findings could be translated into real-world applications, or making specific recommendations for practice, policy, design, or intervention. (May be very concise in Abstracts; more elaborated in Conclusions if based on Discussion).
    - **Primary IMRaD Location for First Introduction/Substantiation:** Discussion
    - **Verification Notes:** Ensure these stem from findings and interpretations explored and justified in the Discussion.
11. **Acknowledgement of Study Limitation(s)**
    - **Scope:** Information Units identifying constraints, weaknesses, caveats, or boundaries related to the study's design, methodology, sample, or the generalizability of its findings. (Very rare in Abstracts; more common and important in Conclusions for balance).
    - **Primary IMRaD Location for First Introduction/Substantiation:** Discussion (most common); Methods (for purely methodological limitations).
    - **Verification Notes:** Verify these are consistent with limitations detailed in the Discussion or Methods. No new, unmentioned limitations should appear in Conclusions. Abstracts typically omit these.
12. **Suggestion for Future Research / Outlook**
    - **Scope:** Information Units proposing specific directions for subsequent studies, new research questions arising from the current findings, or areas needing further investigation, including a broader outlook. (May be very brief or absent in Abstracts; more common and detailed in Conclusions).
    - **Primary IMRaD Location for First Introduction/Substantiation:** Discussion
    - **Verification Notes:** Check that these suggestions logically arise from the study and summarize detailed suggestions from the Discussion. Abstracts rarely detail this.
13. **Overall Concluding Remark / Take-Home Message**    
    - **Scope:** An Information Unit (IU) (often a full sentence when not further chunked, or a dominant clause) providing a final, high-level summary that encapsulates the main essence of the study's findings and their importance. (This is the culminating statement for both Abstracts and Conclusions).
    - **Primary IMRaD Location for First Introduction/Substantiation:** Content derived from Results and Discussion; specific phrasing is unique to summary sections.
    - **Verification Notes:** The message must be a fair and accurate representation of substantiated contributions detailed in Results/Discussion and should not introduce new substantive claims.
