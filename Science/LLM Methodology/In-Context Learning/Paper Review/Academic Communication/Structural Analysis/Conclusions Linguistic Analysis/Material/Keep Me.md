Perhaps, I should also mention, that the workflow attempts specifically define sufficiency check for the action (verb + modifiers) and concept / scope modifiers (syntactic object, including modifiers). Action is often linked in a less direct fashion to antecedent, like in case of interpretive claims (illustrates, demonstrates, suggests, etc.).

In fact, whether the action is properly supported may be beyond the scope of pronoun ambiguity check. It does not matter whether pronoun is used when rereferring to routinely mentioned technique as "demonstration of its power". This might be a good candidate for separate semantic check irrespective of the vague pronoun use. On the other hand, the use of standalone "this" may often interfere with writer's own ability to understand and see issue in their writing. For example, if the author of this text:

~~~

Five other 17O-labeled compounds were also prepared from the 17O-labeled water (...) and characterized by NMR and GC-MS. This illustrates the power of 17O NMR in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups.

~~~

would attempt to disambiguate "this" properly, they perhaps would see that a clear subject, appropriate for the routine non-specific mentioning of NMR (it does not even specify the kind of NMR, even though this detail can be inferred if the entire paper is considered) would look very odd when combined with "illustrates the power of 17O NMR" even without the more detailed scope.

The head noun of the object, "power" is also fairly abstract consistent with interpretive claim, and even with its essential first level modifier "power of 17O NMR" may not be a straightforward task for the AI to judge, whether the antecedent appropriately supports it. This pattern, however, might be another specific, but a fairly common abstract pattern, present in conclusions (interpretive claims with pronoun must refer to local context, but, generally, these kind of claims should have one of the important results of the study, as its implied antecedent, not a routinely used/mentioned standard technique).

But the rest of the syntactic object, particularly the modifiers, should probably be more concrete and more directly present in the antecedent context. Hence, the attempt to explicitly separate "substantive components" and "Action/Verb" in the prompt workflow.
