> An inexpensive, straightforward method for enriching $^{17}$O-labeled water from tap water and the subsequent preparation of $^{17}$O-labeled hydrogen peroxide from electrolysis of H$_{2}^{17}$O are described in this paper. The fractional distillation method for enrichment of H$_{2}^{17}$O reported here can greatly enrich the percentage of H$_{2}^{17}$O or H$_{2}^{18}$O which are both useful for isotope studies. From approximately 500 mL of 40-fold enriched water, about 90 mL of H$_{2}^{17}$O was obtained. The most practical method for determining the enrichment was found to be the reaction of the H$_{2^{17}}O$ with BSTFA to yield hexamethyldisiloxane which was quantified by GC-MS analysis. Five other 1"O-labeled compounds were also prepared from the 170-labeled water (sodium hydroxide, 1-hexanol, hydrogen peroxide, trimethylsilanol, and camphor) and characterized by NMR and GC-MS. This illustrates the power of 170 NMR in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups. Finally, an unexpected exchange reaction of primary alcohol moieties with water, facilitated by ketones, was detected by 170 NMR.

**Processing Sentence 6:** "This illustrates the power of 170 NMR in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups."

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:**
    - **Pronoun:** This
    - **Vagueness/Ambiguity Analysis:**
        1. **Pronoun Context Definition:** The pronoun "This" stands for a set of actions or results that serve to illustrate something. Its specific meaning is defined by its clause:
            - **Action:** illustrates
            - **Concept:** the power of $^{17}$O NMR
            - **Condition/Scope Modifier:** in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups
        2. **Antecedent Identification:** The antecedent is the cumulative action described in the preceding sentence (Sentence 5): The preparation of five different $^{17}$O-labeled compounds and their subsequent characterization by NMR and GC-MS.
        3. **Sufficiency Check:**
            - **Action (illustrates):** Supported. The act of successfully preparing and characterizing a diverse set of compounds (the antecedent) serves as a direct and logical basis for 'illustrating' the utility of the technique used.
            - **Concept (the power of $^{17}$O NMR):** Supported. The antecedent explicitly states that the compounds were "characterized by NMR" . Given the subject of the paper, this implies $^{17}$O NMR, and successfully using it on five different compounds demonstrates its 'power'.
            - **Condition/Scope Modifier (in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups):** Supported. The antecedent explicitly lists the compounds prepared, including "sodium hydroxide, 1-hexanol, hydrogen peroxide, trimethylsilanol, and camphor" , all of which contain oxygen. Characterizing these products is a method of detecting the reactions that formed them. The antecedent therefore provides direct textual support for this component.
    - **Conclusion:** The pronoun "This" is not vague. The actions described in the antecedent sentence fully and explicitly support the specific context carried by the pronoun.
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from previous sentence. Sentence 5 lists a series of experimental achievements, and Sentence 6 provides the broader implication or significance of those achievements.

> An inexpensive, straightforward method for enriching ¹⁷O-labeled water from tap water and the subsequent preparation of ¹⁷O-labeled hydrogen peroxide from electrolysis of H₂¹⁷O are described in this paper. The fractional distillation method for enrichment of H₂¹⁷O reported here can greatly enrich the percentage of H₂¹⁷O or H₂¹⁸O which are both useful for isotope studies. From approximately 500 mL of 40-fold enriched water, about 90 mL of H₂¹⁷O was obtained. The most practical method for determining the enrichment was found to be the reaction of the H₂¹⁷O with BSTFA to yield hexamethyldisiloxane which was quantified by GC-MS analysis. Five other ¹⁷O-labeled compounds were also prepared from the ¹⁷O-labeled water (sodium hydroxide, 1-hexanol, hydrogen peroxide, trimethylsilanol, and camphor) and characterized by NMR and GC-MS. This illustrates the power of ¹⁷O NMR in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups.

### **Phase 3: Linguistic Flow and Pronoun Reference Analysis

---

**Processing Sentence 1:** "An inexpensive, straightforward method for enriching ¹⁷O-labeled water from tap water and the subsequent preparation of ¹⁷O-labeled hydrogen peroxide from electrolysis of H₂¹⁷O are described in this paper." 10

- **Flow Analysis:** N/A (first sentence).

---

**Processing Sentence 2:** "The fractional distillation method for enrichment of H₂¹⁷O reported here can greatly enrich the percentage of H₂¹⁷O or H₂¹⁸O which are both useful for isotope studies." 11

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence. The relative pronoun "which" clearly refers to its immediate antecedent, "H₂¹⁷O or H₂¹⁸O," and does not create ambiguity.
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from the previous sentence. The first sentence introduces the general topic of enriching water, and this sentence specifies one of the methods used ("fractional distillation").

---

**Processing Sentence 3:** "From approximately 500 mL of 40-fold enriched water, about 90 mL of H₂¹⁷O was obtained." 12

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence.
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from the previous sentence. The preceding sentence discusses the enrichment method, and this sentence provides a quantitative result of that process.

---

**Processing Sentence 4:** "The most practical method for determining the enrichment was found to be the reaction of the H₂¹⁷O with BSTFA to yield hexamethyldisiloxane which was quantified by GC-MS analysis." 13

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence. The relative pronoun "which" clearly refers to its immediate antecedent, "hexamethyldisiloxane."
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from the previous sentence. The preceding sentences establish the existence of enriched water, and this sentence logically moves to the topic of how that enrichment was quantified.

---

**Processing Sentence 5:** "Five other ¹⁷O-labeled compounds were also prepared from the ¹⁷O-labeled water (sodium hydroxide, 1-hexanol, hydrogen peroxide, trimethylsilanol, and camphor) and characterized by NMR and GC-MS." 14

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence.
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from the previous sentence. The preceding sentences focus on the enriched water itself; this sentence expands the scope to describe other compounds synthesized using that water.

---

**Processing Sentence 6:** "This illustrates the power of ¹⁷O NMR in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups." 15

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** The pronoun "This" requires analysis.
    
    - **Vagueness/Ambiguity Analysis:**
        
        1. **Pronoun Context Definition:** The pronoun "This" acts as the subject of the verb "illustrates." The context it represents is defined by the verb's object phrase and its modifiers:
            - **Action:** illustrates
            - **Concept:** the power of ¹⁷O NMR
            - **Scope/Purpose Modifier:** in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups.
        2. **Antecedent Identification:** The most plausible antecedent is the entire preceding sentence: "Five other ¹⁷O-labeled compounds were also prepared from the ¹⁷O-labeled water (sodium hydroxide, 1-hexanol, hydrogen peroxide, trimethylsilanol, and camphor) and characterized by NMR and GC-MS." 16
            
        3. **Sufficiency Check:**
            - **Action (illustrates):** Supported. The antecedent action of preparing and characterizing several distinct compounds provides a direct and logical basis for the framing verb "illustrates," as these activities serve as examples of a broader capability.
            - **Concept (the power of ¹⁷O NMR):** Not Explicitly Supported. The antecedent text states that characterization was performed using "NMR and GC-MS"17. It does not single out or specify "¹⁷O NMR" nor does it contain the evaluative term "power."
                
            - **Scope/Purpose Modifier (in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups):** Not Explicitly Supported. The antecedent states the compounds were "prepared" and "characterized"18. It does not explicitly mention "the detection of... reactions." While characterization is a key part of studying reactions, the antecedent text itself does not make this specific connection.
                
    - **Conclusion:** The pronoun "**This**" is **vague**. The identified antecedent in the preceding sentence does not explicitly contain all the semantic components required to fully support the pronoun's context. Specifically, the antecedent does not mention "the power of ¹⁷O NMR" or "the detection of reactions," requiring the reader to make an inference beyond the provided text of the conclusion.
        
- **Flow Analysis:** The flow is potentially disrupted by the vagueness of the pronoun "This." While the sentence attempts to build on the previous one, the logical leap from "characterizing compounds" to "illustrating the power of ¹⁷O NMR in detecting reactions" is not fully supported by the explicit text, creating a slight gap in reasoning.
    

---

**Processing Sentence 7:** "Finally, an unexpected exchange reaction of primary alcohol moieties with water, facilitated by ketones, was detected by ¹⁷O NMR." 19

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence.
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from the previous sentence. The sentence is clearly marked as the final point by the adverb "Finally" and presents a specific, noteworthy finding.

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence. The relative pronoun "which" has a clear and immediate antecedent ("H$_{2}^{17}$O or H$_{2}^{18}$O") within the same sentence. 18
    
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from the previous sentence. It specifies a key technique ("fractional distillation") that falls under the general "method for enriching" introduced in the first sentence. 19

##### **Processing Sentence 6:** "This illustrates the power of $^{17}$O NMR in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups." 25

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:**
    - **Pronoun:** `This`
    - **Vagueness/Ambiguity Analysis:**
        1. **Pronoun Context Definition:** The pronoun `This` carries the contextual meaning of an action or set of results that serves to demonstrate a broad scientific capability. The specific components of this context are:
            - **Action:** illustrates
            - **Concept:** the power of $^{17}$O NMR
            - **Scope Modifier:** in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups
        2. **Antecedent Identification:** The most plausible antecedent is the entirety of the action described in the preceding sentence (Sentence 5): the preparation and characterization of five specific $^{17}$O-labeled compounds by NMR and GC-MS. 26
            
        3. **Sufficiency Check:**
            - **Action (illustrates):** Supported. The act of preparing and successfully characterizing a series of compounds (Sentence 5) provides a direct logical basis for 'illustrating' a broader principle or capability. 27
                
            - **Concept (the power of $^{17}$O NMR):** Not Explicitly Supported. The antecedent text in Sentence 5 states the compounds were "characterized by NMR and GC-MS," but it does not explicitly contain the concept of the "power" of this technique. 28 This is an interpretation of the results, not an explicit statement within the antecedent.
                
            - **Scope Modifier (in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups):** Not Explicitly Supported. The antecedent in Sentence 5 lists the compounds that were prepared and characterized, but it does not explicitly state that this work demonstrates a general capability for "the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups." 29 This is a broader conclusion inferred from the specific work described. The pronoun's reference is therefore vague as it refers to a concept (the demonstration of a general capability) that is not fully and explicitly stated in the preceding text of the 'Conclusions' section.
                
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from the previous sentence. The sentence attempts to make a summary statement based on the evidence presented in the prior sentence.

            - **Concept (the power of $^{17}$O NMR):** Not Explicitly Supported. The antecedent text states the compounds were "characterized by NMR and GC-MS"20. It does not specify that $^{17}$O NMR in particular was the powerful tool, nor does it use the word "power." This connection requires inference beyond the explicit text of the 'Conclusions' section.
                
            - **Condition/Scope Modifier (in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups):** Not Explicitly Supported. The antecedent states the compounds were "prepared... and characterized"21. It does not explicitly mention that this characterization involved the "detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups." This is a conceptual summary not directly stated in the antecedent sentence.
                
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from previous sentence. Sentence 5 provides a list of experimental achievements, and Sentence 6 attempts to frame the broader significance of these achievements.

##### **Processing Sentence 7:**

"Finally, an unexpected exchange reaction of primary alcohol moieties with water, facilitated by ketones, was detected by $^{17}$O NMR22."

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence.
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from previous sentence. The use of "Finally" clearly signals a concluding point. The sentence introduces a final, notable finding, which serves as an effective capstone to the summary of results.

#### **Full Text of Identified 'Conclusions' Section:**

> An inexpensive, straightforward method for enriching ¹⁷O-labeled water from tap water and the subsequent preparation of ¹⁷O-labeled hydrogen peroxide from electrolysis of H₂¹⁷O are described in this paper. The fractional distillation method for enrichment of H₂¹⁷O reported here can greatly enrich the percentage of H₂¹⁷O or H₂¹⁸O which are both useful for isotope studies. From approximately 500 mL of 40-fold enriched water, about 90 mL of H₂¹⁷O was obtained. The most practical method for determining the enrichment was found to be the reaction of the H₂¹⁷O with BSTFA to yield hexamethyldisiloxane which was quantified by GC-MS analysis. Five other ¹⁷O-labeled compounds were also prepared from the ¹⁷O-labeled water (sodium hydroxide, 1-hexanol, hydrogen peroxide, trimethylsilanol, and camphor) and characterized by NMR and GC-MS. This illustrates the power of ¹⁷O NMR in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups. Finally, an unexpected exchange reaction of primary alcohol moieties with water, facilitated by ketones, was detected by ¹⁷O NMR.

            - **Concept (the power of 170 NMR):** Not Explicitly Supported. The antecedent states that NMR was _used_ to characterize compounds, but the word "power" is an interpretation of the effectiveness of that use, not something explicitly stated in the antecedent text.
            - **Scope Modifier (in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups):** Not Explicitly Supported. The antecedent states that "compounds were... characterized," which is the outcome. It does not explicitly mention the act of "detection of the reactions" that formed them, nor does it explicitly mention "O-containing functional groups," though this is implied by the list of compounds. The link requires inference.
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from previous sentence. The sentence serves as a concluding statement summarizing the significance of the results detailed in Sentence 5.

##### **Processing Sentence 7:** "Finally, an unexpected exchange reaction of primary alcohol moieties with water, facilitated by ketones, was detected by 170 NMR." 16

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence.
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from previous sentence. The use of the adverb "Finally" clearly signals a shift to the last key finding of the paper, while still relating to the overarching theme of detection by NMR.

            - **Scope Modifier (in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups):** Not Explicitly Supported. The antecedent text 24 states that _compounds_ were prepared and characterized. It does not explicitly state that $^{17}$O NMR was used to detect or study the _reactions_ of these compounds' functional groups. The antecedent supports the characterization of static compounds, not the observation of dynamic reactions. Therefore, the pronoun "This" is flagged as vague, as its reference is not fully supported by the explicit text of the antecedent.

> An inexpensive, straightforward method for enriching ¹⁷O-labeled water from tap water and the subsequent preparation of ¹⁷O-labeled hydrogen peroxide from electrolysis of H₂¹⁷O are described in this paper. 2 The fractional distillation method for enrichment of H₂¹⁷O reported here can greatly enrich the percentage of H₂¹⁷O or H₂¹⁸O which are both useful for isotope studies. 3 From approximately 500 mL of 40-fold enriched water, about 90 mL of H₂¹⁷O was obtained. 4 The most practical method for determining the enrichment was found to be the reaction of the H₂¹⁷O with BSTFA to yield hexamethyldisiloxane which was quantified by GC-MS analysis. 5 Five other ¹⁷O-labeled compounds were also prepared from the ¹⁷O-labeled water (sodium hydroxide, 1-hexanol, hydrogen peroxide, trimethylsilanol, and camphor) and characterized by NMR and GC-MS. 6 This illustrates the power of ¹⁷O NMR in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups. 7 Finally, an unexpected exchange reaction of primary alcohol moieties with water, facilitated by ketones, was detected by ¹⁷O NMR. 8

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis were identified in this sentence. The relative pronoun "which" has a clear and immediate antecedent ("hexamethyldisiloxane").
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from the previous sentence. The focus logically shifts from the enrichment process to the method used to quantify that enrichment.

---

**Processing Sentence 5:** "Five other ¹⁷O-labeled compounds were also prepared from the ¹⁷O-labeled water (sodium hydroxide, 1-hexanol, hydrogen peroxide, trimethylsilanol, and camphor) and characterized by NMR and GC-MS." 20

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis were identified in this sentence.
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from the previous sentence. The use of "also" effectively links this sentence, which broadens the scope to the preparation of other labeled compounds, to the preceding discussions of using the enriched water.

---

**Processing Sentence 6:** "This illustrates the power of ¹⁷O NMR in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups." 21

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:**
    
    - **Pronoun:** This
    - **Vagueness/Ambiguity Analysis:**
        1. **Pronoun Context Definition:**
            - **Action:** illustrates
            - **Concept:** the power of ¹⁷O NMR
            - **Scope Modifier:** in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups
        2. **Antecedent Identification:** The most plausible antecedent is the action described in the preceding sentence: "Five other ¹⁷O-labeled compounds were also prepared... and characterized by NMR and GC-MS." 22
            
        3. **Sufficiency Check:**
            - **Action (illustrates):** Supported (The act of preparing and characterizing compounds is a direct logical basis for 'illustrating' a broader capability).
            - **Concept (the power of ¹⁷O NMR):** Not Explicitly Supported (The antecedent states characterization was done by "NMR and GC-MS"23, not specifically "¹⁷O NMR." The antecedent also does not contain the evaluative term "power").
                
            - **Scope Modifier (in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups):** Not Explicitly Supported (The antecedent mentions the preparation and characterization of compounds but does not explicitly state that this process involved the "detection of... reactions").
    - **Conclusion:** The pronoun "This" is flagged as **vague**. Its full contextual meaning is not explicitly supported by the text of the antecedent within the conclusions section. A reader must infer that "NMR" means "¹⁷O NMR," that successful characterization demonstrates "power," and that characterization is synonymous with "detection of reactions."
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from the previous sentence. The sentence makes a general claim based on the specific evidence provided in the prior sentence.
    

---

**Processing Sentence 7:** "Finally, an unexpected exchange reaction of primary alcohol moieties with water, facilitated by ketones, was detected by ¹⁷O NMR." 24

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis were identified in this sentence.
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from the previous sentence. The use of "Finally" clearly marks this as the last major finding, which serves as another example supporting the "power of ¹⁷O NMR" mentioned in the previous sentence.
