> An inexpensive, straightforward method for enriching &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled water from tap water and the subsequent preparation of &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled hydrogen peroxide from electrolysis of H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O are described in this paper. The fractional distillation method for enrichment of H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O reported here can greatly enrich the percentage of H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O or H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>18&lt;/sup>O which are both useful for isotope studies. From approximately 500 mL of 40-fold enriched water, about 90 mL of H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O was obtained. The most practical method for determining the enrichment was found to be the reaction of the H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O with BSTFA to yield hexamethyldisiloxane which was quantified by GC-MS analysis. Five other &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled compounds were also prepared from the &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled water (sodium hydroxide, 1-hexanol, hydrogen peroxide, trimethylsilanol, and camphor) and characterized by NMR and GC-MS. This illustrates the power of &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups. Finally, an unexpected exchange reaction of primary alcohol moieties with water, facilitated by ketones, was detected by &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR.

### **Linguistic Flow and Pronoun Reference Analysis:**

**Processing Sentence 1:** "An inexpensive, straightforward method for enriching &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled water from tap water and the subsequent preparation of &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled hydrogen peroxide from electrolysis of H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O are described in this paper."

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence. The phrase "this paper" uses "this" as a determiner, which is acceptable per Constraint 2.
- **Flow Analysis:** N/A (first sentence).

---

**Processing Sentence 2:** "The fractional distillation method for enrichment of H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O reported here can greatly enrich the percentage of H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O or H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>18&lt;/sup>O which are both useful for isotope studies."

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence. The relative pronoun "which" clearly refers to "H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O or H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>18&lt;/sup>O".
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from the previous sentence. It specifies the type of method ("fractional distillation") introduced in the first sentence.

---

**Processing Sentence 3:** "From approximately 500 mL of 40-fold enriched water, about 90 mL of H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O was obtained."

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence.
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from the previous sentence. It provides a quantitative result of the enrichment method.

---

**Processing Sentence 4:** "The most practical method for determining the enrichment was found to be the reaction of the H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O with BSTFA to yield hexamethyldisiloxane which was quantified by GC-MS analysis."

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence. The relative pronoun "which" clearly refers to "hexamethyldisiloxane".
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from the previous sentence. It moves logically from the result of the enrichment to the method used to measure it.

---

**Processing Sentence 5:** "Five other &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled compounds were also prepared from the &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled water (sodium hydroxide, 1-hexanol, hydrogen peroxide, trimethylsilanol, and camphor) and characterized by NMR and GC-MS."

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence.
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from the previous sentence. The use of "also prepared" logically extends the scope from the initial products to other synthesized compounds.

---

**Processing Sentence 6:** "This illustrates the power of &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups."

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:**
    
    - **Pronoun:** "This"
    - **Vagueness/Ambiguity Analysis:**
        1. **Pronoun Context Definition:**
            - **Action:** illustrates
            - **Concept:** the power of &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR
            - **Scope Modifier 1:** in the detection
            - **Scope Modifier 2:** of the reactions of O-containing functional groups
        2. **Antecedent Identification:** The most plausible antecedent is the entirety of Sentence 5: "Five other &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled compounds were also prepared from the &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled water (sodium hydroxide, 1-hexanol, hydrogen peroxide, trimethylsilanol, and camphor) and characterized by NMR and GC-MS."
        3. **Sufficiency Check:**
            - **Action (illustrates):** **Supported**. The act of preparing and characterizing compounds is a direct logical basis for providing an 'illustration' of a technique's utility.
            - **Concept (the power of &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR):** **Not Explicitly Supported**. The antecedent states only that NMR was used for characterization, not that this demonstrated its "power." This is an interpretive claim not directly stated in the antecedent text.
            - **Scope Modifier 1 (in the detection):** **Supported**. "Characterized by NMR" is a direct semantic equivalent of using NMR for "detection" in this scientific context.
            - **Scope Modifier 2 (of the reactions of O-containing functional groups):** **Not Explicitly Supported**. The antecedent lists prepared _compounds_ but does not explicitly mention the "reactions" or the "O-containing functional groups" that were involved. The pronoun's context makes a conceptual leap from the characterization of products to the detection of the reactions that formed them, a detail not present in the antecedent sentence.
    - **Conclusion:** The pronoun **"This" is vague** because key components of its implied meaning (the "power" of the technique and the "reactions of... functional groups") are not explicitly supported by the text of the antecedent within the 'Conclusions' section.
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from the previous sentence. The sentence aims to draw a conclusion from the evidence presented in the prior sentence.
    

---

**Processing Sentence 7:** "Finally, an unexpected exchange reaction of primary alcohol moieties with water, facilitated by ketones, was detected by &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR."

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence.
- **Flow Analysis:** The transition is slightly abrupt. Sentence 6 offered a broad concluding statement on the power of a technique, which typically signals the end of a line of reasoning. Sentence 7 then introduces a new, highly specific, and "unexpected" finding. While linked by the common technique (&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR), its placement after a summary statement feels like an addendum rather than a smoothly integrated final point.

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence. The relative pronoun "which" has a clear and immediate antecedent ("H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O or H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>18&lt;/sup>O") within the same sentence.
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from the previous sentence. It specifies the "method" introduced in Sentence 1 as "fractional distillation."

---

**Processing Sentence 3:** "From approximately 500 mL of 40-fold enriched water, about 90 mL of H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O was obtained."

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence.
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from the previous sentence. It provides a specific quantitative result for the enrichment method.

---

**Processing Sentence 4:** "The most practical method for determining the enrichment was found to be the reaction of the H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O with BSTFA to yield hexamethyldisiloxane which was quantified by GC-MS analysis."

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence. The relative pronoun "which" clearly refers to its immediate antecedent, "hexamethyldisiloxane."
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from the previous sentence. It logically moves from the enrichment result to the method of analyzing that result.

---

**Processing Sentence 5:** "Five other &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled compounds were also prepared from the &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled water (sodium hydroxide, 1-hexanol, hydrogen peroxide, trimethylsilanol, and camphor) and characterized by NMR and GC-MS."

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence.
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from the previous sentence. It broadens the scope from the production of enriched water to its application in synthesizing other labeled compounds.

---

**Processing Sentence 6:** "This illustrates the power of &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups."

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:**
    - **Pronoun:** This
    - **Vagueness/Ambiguity Analysis:**
        1. **Pronoun Context Definition:** The pronoun "This" stands for a concept or action that serves to illustrate something. The specific context is defined by its clause:
            - **Action:** illustrates
            - **Concept:** the power of &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR
            - **Scope Modifier:** in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups
        2. **Antecedent Identification:** The most plausible antecedent is the entirety of the preceding sentence (Sentence 5): "Five other &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled compounds were also prepared from the &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled water (sodium hydroxide, 1-hexanol, hydrogen peroxide, trimethylsilanol, and camphor) and characterized by NMR and GC-MS."
        3. **Sufficiency Check:**
            - **Action (illustrates):** **Supported**. The action in the antecedent (preparing and characterizing several compounds) serves as a direct logical basis for providing an 'illustration' of a technique's capability.
            - **Concept (the power of &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR):** **Supported**. The antecedent explicitly states that the characterization was performed using "NMR," which in this context clearly refers to &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR. Successfully characterizing five different compounds demonstrates its 'power'.
            - **Scope Modifier (in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups):** **Not Explicitly Supported**. The antecedent states that compounds were "prepared" and "characterized." It does not explicitly state that "reactions" were detected. It states the _products_ of reactions were characterized. The link between characterizing a product and detecting the reaction itself is an inference not explicitly stated in the antecedent text.
    - **Conclusion:** The pronoun **'This' is vague** because a key component of its defined meaning (specifically, "the detection of the reactions") is not explicitly supported by the provided text of the antecedent. The antecedent focuses on the characterization of final products, not the monitoring of the reactions that formed them.
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from the previous sentence. The sentence structure logically connects to the prior statement.

---

**Processing Sentence 7:** "Finally, an unexpected exchange reaction of primary alcohol moieties with water, facilitated by ketones, was detected by &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR."

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence.
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from the previous sentence. The adverb "Finally" clearly signals that this is the last piece of concluding information, presenting a distinct and noteworthy finding.

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence.
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from previous sentence. Sentence 1 introduces a "method," and Sentence 2 elaborates on this specific method ("fractional distillation").

---

##### **Processing Sentence 3:** From approximately 500 mL of 40-fold enriched water, about 90 mL of H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O was obtained.

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence.
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from previous sentence. Sentence 2 discusses the enrichment capability of the method, and Sentence 3 provides a specific quantitative result of that enrichment.

---

##### **Processing Sentence 4:** The most practical method for determining the enrichment was found to be the reaction of the H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O with BSTFA to yield hexamethyldisiloxane which was quantified by GC-MS analysis.

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence.
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from previous sentence. After discussing the method and its result, the text logically moves to the method used for "determining the enrichment."

---

##### **Processing Sentence 5:** Five other &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled compounds were also prepared from the &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled water (sodium hydroxide, 1-hexanol, hydrogen peroxide, trimethylsilanol, and camphor) and characterized by NMR and GC-MS.

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence.
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from previous sentence. The sentence logically broadens the scope from the enrichment process to other applications ("Five other... compounds were also prepared").

---

##### **Processing Sentence 6:** This illustrates the power of &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups.

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:**
    
    - **Pronoun:** "This"
    - **Vagueness/Ambiguity Analysis:**
        1. **Pronoun Context Definition:** The pronoun "This" represents a concept that fulfills the following specific role in the sentence:
            - **Action:** illustrates
            - **Concept:** the power of &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR

        3. **Sufficiency Check:**
            - **Action (illustrates):** **Supported.** The act of preparing and characterizing several compounds is a direct logical basis for 'illustrating' the utility of a technique.
            - **Concept (the power of &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR):** **Not Explicitly Supported.** The antecedent text states the compounds were characterized by "NMR and GC-MS." It does not specify that &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR in particular was used, nor does it contain any text qualifying the technique as "powerful." This is an assertion that is not explicitly supported by the direct textual antecedent.
            - **Condition/Scope Modifier (in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups):** **Supported.** The antecedent describes preparing and characterizing various &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled compounds, which directly involves the reactions and detection of oxygen-containing groups.
    - **Conclusion:** The pronoun **"This" is flagged as vague**. Its use requires the reader to infer that the characterization mentioned in the previous sentence not only used &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR specifically but that the results demonstrated its "power." This information is not explicitly present in the antecedent text within the 'Conclusions' section.
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from previous sentence. The sentence attempts to draw a conclusion based on the experimental work described in Sentence 5.
    

---

##### **Processing Sentence 7:** Finally, an unexpected exchange reaction of primary alcohol moieties with water, facilitated by ketones, was detected by &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR.

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence.
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from previous sentence. The adverb "Finally" clearly signals a concluding point, and the sentence presents another specific finding related to the use of &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR.

### **Phase 3: Linguistic Flow and Pronoun Reference Analysis**

#### **Processing Sentence 1:**

"An inexpensive, straightforward method for enriching &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled water from tap water and the subsequent preparation of &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled hydrogen peroxide from electrolysis of H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O are described in this paper."

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence. The phrase "this paper" uses "this" as a determiner, which is not flagged as vague per the instructions.
- **Flow Analysis:** N/A (first sentence).

#### **Processing Sentence 2:**

"The fractional distillation method for enrichment of H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O reported here can greatly enrich the percentage of H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O or H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>18&lt;/sup>O which are both useful for isotope studies."

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence.
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from previous sentence. It specifies the "method" introduced in Sentence 1 as "The fractional distillation method".

#### **Processing Sentence 3:**

"From approximately 500 mL of 40-fold enriched water, about 90 mL of H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O was obtained."

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence.
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from previous sentence. It provides a specific quantitative result for the "enrichment" process mentioned in Sentence 2.

#### **Processing Sentence 4:**

"The most practical method for determining the enrichment was found to be the reaction of the H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O with BSTFA to yield hexamethyldisiloxane which was quantified by GC-MS analysis."

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence.
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from previous sentence. It shifts logically from the result of the enrichment to the method used to measure that result.

#### **Processing Sentence 5:**

"Five other &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled compounds were also prepared from the &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled water (sodium hydroxide, 1-hexanol, hydrogen peroxide, trimethylsilanol, and camphor) and characterized by NMR and GC-MS."

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence.
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from previous sentence. The use of "also prepared" clearly connects to the previous synthesis activities and broadens the scope of the work.

#### **Processing Sentence 6:**

"This illustrates the power of &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups."

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:**
    
    - **Pronoun:** "This"
    - **Vagueness/Ambiguity Analysis:**
        1. **Pronoun Context Definition:** The pronoun "This" carries a specific meaning derived from its clause:
            - **Action:** illustrates
            - **Concept:** the power of &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR
            - **Scope Modifier 1 (of the power):** in the detection of the reactions
            - **Scope Modifier 2 (of the reactions):** of O-containing functional groups
        2. **Antecedent Identification:** The most plausible antecedent is the action described in the preceding sentence (Sentence 5): "Five other &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled compounds were also prepared from the &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled water... and characterized by NMR and GC-MS."
        3. **Sufficiency Check:**
            - **Action (illustrates):** **Supported**. The act of preparing and successfully characterizing several compounds via NMR is a direct logical basis for 'illustrating' the capability of that technique.
            - **Concept (the power of &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR):** **Supported**. The antecedent explicitly states the compounds were "characterized by NMR and GC-MS," which demonstrates the utility ("power") of the technique.
            - **Scope Modifier 1 (in the detection of the reactions):** **Not Explicitly Supported**. The antecedent mentions that compounds were "prepared" (which are reactions) and "characterized," but it does not explicitly state that the _reactions themselves_ were detected. The focus is on the characterization of the final products.
            - **Scope Modifier 2 (of O-containing functional groups):** **Supported**. The antecedent lists five compounds (sodium hydroxide, 1-hexanol, etc.) that all contain oxygen, and the work originates from &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled water, making the focus on O-containing groups clear.
        4. **Conclusion on Vagueness:** The pronoun "This" is **vague**. While the antecedent in Sentence 5 provides context for most of the pronoun's meaning, it does not explicitly support the idea of "detection of the reactions." A reader cannot confirm from the preceding text alone that the reactions themselves were being detected, only that the resulting products were characterized.
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from previous sentence. The sentence serves as an interpretation of the evidence presented in Sentence 5.
    

#### **Processing Sentence 7:**

"Finally, an unexpected exchange reaction of primary alcohol moieties with water, facilitated by ketones, was detected by &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR."

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence.
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from previous sentence. The adverb "Finally" appropriately signals a last, distinct finding.

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** The demonstrative "this" is used as a determiner modifying the noun "paper." The resulting phrase "this paper" has a clear and unambiguous meaning in this context and is not flagged as vague.
- **Flow Analysis:** N/A (first sentence).

### Processing Sentence 2:

> The fractional distillation method for enrichment of H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O reported here can greatly enrich the percentage of H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O or H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>18&lt;/sup>O which are both useful for isotope studies.

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence. The relative pronoun "which" clearly refers to "H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O or H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>18&lt;/sup>O."
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from the previous sentence. It specifies the "method" mentioned in Sentence 1 as the "fractional distillation method."

### Processing Sentence 3:

> From approximately 500 mL of 40-fold enriched water, about 90 mL of H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O was obtained.

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence.
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from the previous sentence. It provides a specific quantitative result of the enrichment process discussed.

### Processing Sentence 4:

> The most practical method for determining the enrichment was found to be the reaction of the H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O with BSTFA to yield hexamethyldisiloxane which was quantified by GC-MS analysis.

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence. The relative pronoun "which" clearly refers to "hexamethyldisiloxane."
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from the previous sentence. The topic logically shifts from the enrichment process to the method used for its quantitative determination.

### Processing Sentence 5:

> Five other &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled compounds were also prepared from the &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled water (sodium hydroxide, 1-hexanol, hydrogen peroxide, trimethylsilanol, and camphor) and characterized by NMR and GC-MS.

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence.
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from the previous sentence. The use of "also" effectively signals an expansion of the topic from the primary enrichment to the synthesis of other related compounds.

### Processing Sentence 6:

> This illustrates the power of &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups.

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:**
    
    - **Pronoun:** This
    - **Vagueness/Ambiguity Analysis:**
        1. **Pronoun Context Definition:**
            - **Action:** illustrates
            - **Concept:** the power of &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR
            - **Condition/Scope Modifier:** in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups
        2. **Antecedent Identification:** The most plausible antecedent is the activity described in the preceding sentence (Sentence 5): "Five other &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled compounds were also prepared from the &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled water ... and characterized by NMR and GC-MS."
        3. **Sufficiency Check:**
            - **Action (illustrates):** **Supported.** The action in the antecedent ('prepared... and characterized by NMR and GC-MS') provides a direct logical basis for the framing verb 'illustrates'.
            - **Concept (the power of &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR):** **Not Explicitly Supported.** The antecedent text states characterization was by "NMR and GC-MS," not specifically "&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR." While this is implied by the paper's overall context, it is not explicitly stated in the antecedent text itself.
            - **Condition/Scope Modifier (in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups):** **Not Explicitly Supported.** The antecedent states that compounds were "prepared" and "characterized." It does not explicitly mention the "detection of reactions" or use the specific phrase "O-containing functional groups." This meaning is inferred rather than being present in the antecedent text.
    - **Conclusion:** The pronoun "**This**" is **vague** because its antecedent in Sentence 5 does not explicitly contain the specific semantic information required to fully support the pronoun's context (specifically, the mention of "&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR" and the concept of "detection of reactions").
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from the previous sentence, as it attempts to interpret the finding presented in Sentence 5.
    

### Processing Sentence 7:

> Finally, an unexpected exchange reaction of primary alcohol moieties with water, facilitated by ketones, was detected by &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR.

### **Phase 3: Linguistic Flow and Pronoun Reference Analysis**

##### **Processing Sentence 1:** An inexpensive, straightforward method for enriching &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled water from tap water and the subsequent preparation of &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled hydrogen peroxide from electrolysis of H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O are described in this paper.

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence. The phrase "this paper" is a standard and unambiguous reference to the document itself.
- **Flow Analysis:** N/A (first sentence).

##### **Processing Sentence 2:** The fractional distillation method for enrichment of H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O reported here can greatly enrich the percentage of H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O or H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>18&lt;/sup>O which are both useful for isotope studies.

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence. The relative pronoun "which" clearly refers to "H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O or H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>18&lt;/sup>O" within the same sentence.
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from the previous sentence. It specifies the general "method" from sentence 1 as a "fractional distillation method."

##### **Processing Sentence 3:** From approximately 500 mL of 40-fold enriched water, about 90 mL of H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O was obtained.

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence.
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from the previous sentence. It provides a specific quantitative result of the enrichment method discussed.

##### **Processing Sentence 4:** The most practical method for determining the enrichment was found to be the reaction of the H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O with BSTFA to yield hexamethyldisiloxane which was quantified by GC-MS analysis.

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence. The relative pronoun "which" clearly refers to "hexamethyldisiloxane" within the same sentence.
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from the previous sentence. It moves logically from the enrichment process to the method of analyzing that enrichment.

##### **Processing Sentence 5:** Five other &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled compounds were also prepared from the &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled water (sodium hydroxide, 1-hexanol, hydrogen peroxide, trimethylsilanol, and camphor) and characterized by NMR and GC-MS.

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence.
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from the previous sentence. It logically extends the scope from the preparation of labeled water to its use in synthesizing other labeled compounds.

##### **Processing Sentence 6:** This illustrates the power of &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups.

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:**
    
    - **Pronoun:** This
    - **Vagueness/Ambiguity Analysis:**
        1. **Pronoun Context Definition:** The pronoun "This" functions as a stand-in for an action or result. The context requires this antecedent to perform a specific function:
            - **Action:** illustrates
            - **Concept:** the power
            - **Subject of Power:** of &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR
            - **Condition/Scope Modifier:** in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups
        2. **Antecedent Identification:** The most plausible antecedent is the entirety of the preceding sentence (Sentence 5): "Five other &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled compounds were also prepared from the &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled water (sodium hydroxide, 1-hexanol, hydrogen peroxide, trimethylsilanol, and camphor) and characterized by NMR and GC-MS."
        3. **Sufficiency Check:**
            - **Action (illustrates):** **Supported**. The act of 'preparing and characterizing' compounds with a specific technique (NMR) is a direct logical basis for 'illustrating' that technique's capabilities.
            - **Concept (the power):** **Not Explicitly Supported**. The antecedent states that compounds were 'characterized,' but the abstract concept of 'power' is not explicitly mentioned. The reader must infer that successful characterization equals power.
            - **Subject of Power (of &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR):** **Supported**. The antecedent explicitly states the compounds were "characterized by NMR," and the entire paper's context is &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O.
            - **Condition/Scope Modifier (in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups):** **Not Explicitly Supported**. The antecedent mentions the _preparation_ and _characterization_ of compounds. It does not explicitly mention the "detection of... reactions." The reader must infer that characterizing these prepared compounds is equivalent to detecting the outcome of reactions.
    - **Conclusion:** The pronoun **'This' is vague**. Its antecedent in Sentence 5 does not explicitly contain the key concepts of "power" or "detection of reactions." For clarity, the sentence could be rephrased to specify what "This" refers to, for instance: "The successful characterization of these compounds illustrates the power of &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR..."
- **Flow Analysis:** The transition is logical, as it draws a conclusion from the results presented in the prior sentence. However, the flow's effectiveness is slightly weakened by the vagueness of the pronoun "This."
    

##### **Processing Sentence 7:** Finally, an unexpected exchange reaction of primary alcohol moieties with water, facilitated by ketones, was detected by &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR.

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence.
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from the previous sentence. It provides a final, specific example of the "power of &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR" mentioned in the preceding sentence, reinforcing that claim.

### **Linguistic Flow and Pronoun Reference Analysis:**

**Processing Sentence 1:** "An inexpensive, straightforward method for enriching &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled water from tap water and the subsequent preparation of &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled hydrogen peroxide from electrolysis of H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O are described in this paper."

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** The phrase "this paper" uses a demonstrative determiner ("this") to modify a noun ("paper"). Per Constraint 2, this construction has a clear, standard meaning within a conclusions section and is not considered vague.
- **Flow Analysis:** N/A (first sentence).

---

**Processing Sentence 2:** "The fractional distillation method for enrichment of H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O reported here can greatly enrich the percentage of H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O or H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>18&lt;/sup>O which are both useful for isotope studies."

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence. The relative pronoun "which" has a clear and immediate grammatical antecedent ("H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O or H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>18&lt;/sup>O").
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from the previous sentence. It specifies the type of method ("fractional distillation") introduced generally in the first sentence.

---

**Processing Sentence 3:** "From approximately 500 mL of 40-fold enriched water, about 90 mL of H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O was obtained."

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence.
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from the previous sentence. It provides a specific quantitative result of the enrichment method.

---

**Processing Sentence 4:** "The most practical method for determining the enrichment was found to be the reaction of the H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O with BSTFA to yield hexamethyldisiloxane which was quantified by GC-MS analysis."

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence. The relative pronoun "which" clearly refers to its immediate grammatical antecedent ("hexamethyldisiloxane").
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from the previous sentence. It logically shifts from the production of the enriched water to the method used to measure that enrichment.

---

**Processing Sentence 5:** "Five other &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled compounds were also prepared from the &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled water (sodium hydroxide, 1-hexanol, hydrogen peroxide, trimethylsilanol, and camphor) and characterized by NMR and GC-MS."

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence.
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from the previous sentence. It broadens the scope from the creation and analysis of labeled water to its use in synthesizing other labeled compounds.

---

**Processing Sentence 6:** "This illustrates the power of &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups."

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** The pronoun "This" requires analysis.
    - **Vagueness/Ambiguity Analysis:**
        1. **Pronoun Context Definition:** The pronoun "This" stands for a concept/action that "illustrates" something specific. The context is broken down as:
            - **Action:** illustrates
            - **Concept:** the power of &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR
            - **Condition/Scope Modifier:** in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups
        2. **Antecedent Identification:** The most plausible antecedent is the action described in the preceding sentence (Sentence 5): "[The preparation and characterization of] Five other &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled compounds... by NMR and GC-MS."
        3. **Sufficiency Check:**
            - **Action (illustrates):** **Supported**. The act of 'characterizing' compounds with a specific technique (NMR) serves as a direct logical basis for 'illustrating' that technique's capabilities.
            - **Concept (the power of &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR):** **Not Explicitly Supported**. The antecedent text states that compounds were "characterized by NMR," but it does not explicitly contain the semantic component of "power." This is an interpretive claim made in the pronoun's sentence.
            - **Condition/Scope Modifier (in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups):** **Not Explicitly Supported**. The antecedent text states compounds were "characterized," which is a general term. It does not explicitly mention that the purpose or result of this characterization was the "detection of reactions" or specify "O-containing functional groups" as the target of this detection within the antecedent sentence itself. The pronoun's clause introduces a specific application that is not explicitly stated in the identified antecedent text.
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from the previous sentence, as it offers an interpretation of the results presented in that sentence.

---

**Processing Sentence 7:** "Finally, an unexpected exchange reaction of primary alcohol moieties with water, facilitated by ketones, was detected by &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR."

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence.
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from the previous sentence. It presents a final, specific discovery made using the mentioned &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR technique.

#### **Processing Sentence 2:**

"The fractional distillation method for enrichment of H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O reported here can greatly enrich the percentage of H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O or H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>18&lt;/sup>O which are both useful for isotope studies."

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence.
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from previous sentence. Sentence 1 introduces a "method," and Sentence 2 provides a specific name for it ("The fractional distillation method").

#### **Processing Sentence 3:**

"From approximately 500 mL of 40-fold enriched water, about 90 mL of H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O was obtained."

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence.
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from previous sentence. It provides a specific quantitative result of the method described previously.

#### **Processing Sentence 4:**

"The most practical method for determining the enrichment was found to be the reaction of the H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O with BSTFA to yield hexamethyldisiloxane which was quantified by GC-MS analysis."

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence.
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from previous sentence. It logically moves from the result of the enrichment to the method used for its measurement.

#### **Processing Sentence 5:**

"Five other &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled compounds were also prepared from the &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled water (sodium hydroxide, 1-hexanol, hydrogen peroxide, trimethylsilanol, and camphor) and characterized by NMR and GC-MS."

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence.
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from previous sentence. It expands on the utility of the enriched water by describing the synthesis of other compounds.

#### **Processing Sentence 6:**

"This illustrates the power of &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups."

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** The pronoun **"This"** is identified for analysis.
    - **Vagueness/Ambiguity Analysis:** **Vague**.
        1. **Pronoun Context Definition:**
            - **Action:** illustrates
            - **Concept:** the power of &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR
            - **Condition/Scope Modifier:** in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups.
        2. **Antecedent Identification:** The most plausible antecedent is the summary of activities in the preceding sentence: "Five other &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled compounds were also prepared... and characterized by NMR and GC-MS."
        3. **Sufficiency Check:**
            - **Action (illustrates):** **Supported**. The act of 'characterizing' compounds with NMR provides a direct logical basis for 'illustrating' the power of that technique.
            - **Concept (the power of &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR):** **Supported**. The antecedent explicitly states the compounds were "characterized by NMR," which directly supports the mention of &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR's power.
            - **Condition/Scope Modifier (in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups):** **Not Explicitly Supported**. The antecedent states compounds were "prepared" and "characterized." It does _not_ explicitly state that the characterization involved "the detection of reactions." This concept is introduced for the first time in the pronoun's clause and is not textually supported by the antecedent.
- **Flow Analysis:** The transition from the previous sentence is weakened by the vague pronoun reference. The sentence attempts to draw a conclusion from the previous statement, but the scope of this conclusion (specifically about "detection of reactions") is not fully supported by the explicit text that comes before it.

#### **Processing Sentence 7:**

"Finally, an unexpected exchange reaction of primary alcohol moieties with water, facilitated by ketones, was detected by &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR."

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence.
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from previous sentence. The use of "Finally" clearly signals a concluding finding, and the sentence provides a specific example of a "reaction... detected by &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR," which connects to the theme of the previous sentence.

- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from the previous sentence. After discussing the enrichment process and result, the text logically moves to the method used for _determining_ that enrichment.

### **Processing Sentence 5:**

"Five other &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled compounds were also prepared from the &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled water (sodium hydroxide, 1-hexanol, hydrogen peroxide, trimethylsilanol, and camphor) and characterized by NMR and GC-MS."

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence.
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from the previous sentence. The focus broadens from the production and analysis of H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O to the subsequent use of this product in preparing other labeled compounds.

### **Processing Sentence 6:**

"This illustrates the power of &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups."

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** The pronoun **"This"** was identified for analysis.
    - **Pronoun Context Definition:**
        - **Action:** illustrates
        - **Concept:** the power of &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR
        - **Scope/Purpose Modifier:** in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups.
    - **Antecedent Identification:** The most plausible antecedent is the action described in the preceding sentence: "Five other &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled compounds were also prepared... and characterized by NMR and GC-MS."
    - **Sufficiency Check:**
        - **Action (illustrates):** **Supported**. The act of successfully preparing and characterizing multiple compounds using a technique is a direct logical basis for a claim that _illustrates_ the capability of that technique.
        - **Concept (the power of &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR):** **Supported**. The antecedent explicitly states that the compounds were "characterized by NMR." Characterizing five distinct compounds demonstrates the "power" or broad applicability of the NMR technique.
        - **Scope/Purpose Modifier (in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups):** **Supported**. The antecedent provides an explicit list of prepared compounds ("sodium hydroxide, 1-hexanol, hydrogen peroxide, trimethylsilanol, and camphor"), all of which are O-containing. Characterizing them with &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR is a direct application of detecting O-containing groups, thus supporting the pronoun's full context.
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from the previous sentence. Sentence 5 states an action (the characterization of several compounds via NMR), and Sentence 6 provides the broader implication or significance of that action.

### **Processing Sentence 7:**

"Finally, an unexpected exchange reaction of primary alcohol moieties with water, facilitated by ketones, was detected by &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR."

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence.
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from the previous sentence. Sentence 6 makes a general claim about the power of &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR, and Sentence 7 provides a final, specific, and noteworthy example of a discovery ("an unexpected exchange reaction") enabled by that technique. The use of "Finally" provides a clear concluding signal.

            - **Action (Illustrates):** **Supported.** The act of preparing and successfully characterizing compounds is a direct logical basis for illustrating the utility or power of the characterization method.
            - **Concept (The power of &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR):** **Not Explicitly Supported.** The antecedent states characterization was by "NMR and GC-MS." It does not specify &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR, nor does it contain any text explicitly stating that the method was "powerful." This is an inference.
            - **Scope Modifier (in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups):** **Not Explicitly Supported.** The antecedent states the compounds were "characterized," which is a general term. It does not explicitly state that this characterization involved the "detection of reactions."
    - **Conclusion:** The pronoun "**This**" is **vague**. Its contextual meaning requires the antecedent to explicitly support the concepts of the "power" of "&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR" and its use in the "detection of reactions," but the antecedent text in Sentence 5 only mentions a general characterization by "NMR and GC-MS" without these specific qualifications.
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from the previous sentence, as it attempts to draw a conclusion based on the evidence presented in Sentence 5.

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** The phrase "this paper" contains the determiner "this" modifying the noun "paper." Per Constraint 2, this is a standard, unambiguous phrase in this context and is not flagged as vague. No other pronouns require analysis.
- **Flow Analysis:** N/A (first sentence).

---

#### **Processing Sentence 2:**

"The fractional distillation method for enrichment of H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O reported here can greatly enrich the percentage of H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O or H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>18&lt;/sup>O which are both useful for isotope studies."

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence. The relative pronoun "which" clearly refers to "H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O or H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>18&lt;/sup>O."
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from previous sentence. It specifies the "method for enriching" introduced generally in Sentence 1.

---

#### **Processing Sentence 3:**

"From approximately 500 mL of 40-fold enriched water, about 90 mL of H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O was obtained."

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence.
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from previous sentence. It provides a specific quantitative result of the "enrichment" method discussed in Sentences 1 and 2.

---

#### **Processing Sentence 4:**

"The most practical method for determining the enrichment was found to be the reaction of the H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O with BSTFA to yield hexamethyldisiloxane which was quantified by GC-MS analysis."

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence. The relative pronoun "which" clearly refers to "hexamethyldisiloxane."
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from previous sentence. The topic logically shifts from the enrichment process to the method used for its quantification.

---

#### **Processing Sentence 5:**

"Five other &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled compounds were also prepared from the &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled water (sodium hydroxide, 1-hexanol, hydrogen peroxide, trimethylsilanol, and camphor) and characterized by NMR and GC-MS."

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence.
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from previous sentence. The use of "also" effectively broadens the discussion from the preparation of H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O to the synthesis of other related compounds.

---

#### **Processing Sentence 6:**

"This illustrates the power of &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups."

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:**
    - **Pronoun:** This
    - **Vagueness/Ambiguity Analysis:**
        1. **Pronoun Context Definition:** The pronoun "This" carries the meaning of an action that "illustrates" a specific concept.
            - **Action:** illustrates
            - **Concept:** the power of &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR
            - **Scope Modifier:** in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups
        2. **Antecedent Identification:** The most plausible antecedent is the entirety of the action described in Sentence 5: "Five other &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled compounds were also prepared from the &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled water... and characterized by NMR and GC-MS."
        3. **Sufficiency Check:**
            - **Action (illustrates):** Supported. The act of preparing and characterizing compounds provides a direct logical basis for 'illustrating' a capability.
            - **Concept (the power of &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR):** Supported. The antecedent explicitly states the compounds were "characterized by NMR," which directly supports the use of &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR.
            - **Scope Modifier (in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups):** **Not Explicitly Supported.** The antecedent text states that compounds were "prepared... and characterized." It does not explicitly mention the "detection of reactions." While characterizing a product can implicitly involve understanding the reaction that formed it, the antecedent text itself does not contain this specific semantic component.
    - **Conclusion:** **The pronoun "This" is VAGUE.** The antecedent in Sentence 5 does not explicitly contain the information to fully support the claim in Sentence 6, specifically regarding the "detection of the reactions." The reader must infer a connection that is not stated in the text of the conclusions.
- **Flow Analysis:** The transition is intended to be a summary statement about the significance of the work described in the prior sentence. However, the logical connection is weakened by the vague pronoun reference.

---

#### **Processing Sentence 7:**

"Finally, an unexpected exchange reaction of primary alcohol moieties with water, facilitated by ketones, was detected by &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR."

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence.
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from previous sentence. The use of "Finally" clearly signals a closing point or an additional key finding, which is topically related to the overall theme of using &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR.

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence.
- **Flow Note:** Smooth transition from previous sentence. The sentence expands the scope of the work, showing further use of the enriched water mentioned previously.

##### **Processing Sentence 6:** This illustrates the power of &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups.

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** The pronoun "This" was identified for analysis.
    - **Vagueness/Ambiguity Analysis:**
        1. **Pronoun Context Definition:** The pronoun "This" stands for an action or set of results that achieves a specific goal. The context is broken down as follows:
            - **Action:** illustrates
            - **Concept:** the power of &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR
            - **Condition/Scope Modifier:** in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups.
        2. **Antecedent Identification:** The most plausible antecedent is the entirety of the preceding sentence (Sentence 5): "Five other &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled compounds were also prepared from the &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled water (sodium hydroxide, 1-hexanol, hydrogen peroxide, trimethylsilanol, and camphor) and characterized by NMR and GC-MS."
        3. **Sufficiency Check:**
            - **Action (illustrates):** **Supported**. The act of preparing and characterizing several compounds (Sentence 5) is a direct and logical basis for 'illustrating' the utility of an analytical technique.
            - **Concept (the power of &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR):** **Not Explicitly Supported**. The antecedent text mentions characterization by "NMR and GC-MS," but it does not specifically mention "&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR" or explicitly state that this action demonstrated its "power."
            - **Condition/Scope Modifier (in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups):** **Not Explicitly Supported**. The antecedent mentions that compounds were "prepared" and "characterized," which implies reactions occurred and were detected. However, it does not use the explicit text "detection of reactions." Furthermore, while the compounds listed are O-containing, the antecedent does not explicitly state that the characterization focused on the "reactions of O-containing functional groups."
    - **Conclusion:** The pronoun "This" is **vague**. The antecedent in Sentence 5 does not contain the explicit textual information required to fully support all specific components of the pronoun's context, particularly the "power of &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR" and the specific action of detecting reactions of "O-containing functional groups." The reader must infer this connection.
- **Flow Note:** The sentence attempts a logical transition by drawing a conclusion from the previous statement, but the flow is weakened by the vague pronoun reference.

##### **Processing Sentence 7:** Finally, an unexpected exchange reaction of primary alcohol moieties with water, facilitated by ketones, was detected by &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR.

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence.
- **Flow Note:** Smooth transition from previous sentence. The word "Finally" clearly signals a new and final point, and the sentence presents another specific finding related to the overall topic of using &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR.

#### **Processing Sentence 5:** "Five other &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled compounds were also prepared from the &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled water (sodium hydroxide, 1-hexanol, hydrogen peroxide, trimethylsilanol, and camphor) and characterized by NMR and GC-MS."

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence.
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from the previous sentence. After discussing the enrichment and its measurement, the focus logically expands to other applications of the enriched water. The use of "also" effectively signals this addition.

---

#### **Processing Sentence 6:** "This illustrates the power of &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups."

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:**
    - **Pronoun:** "This"
    - **Vagueness/Ambiguity Analysis:**
        1. **Pronoun Context Definition:** The pronoun "This" stands for an action or finding that serves as an illustration. The context requires the antecedent to support the concept of "illustrating the power of &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR" specifically for "the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups."
            - **Action:** Illustrates
            - **Concept:** The power of &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR
            - **Scope Modifier:** In the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups
        2. **Antecedent Identification:** The most plausible antecedent is the entirety of Sentence 5: "Five other &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled compounds were also prepared from the &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled water (sodium hydroxide, 1-hexanol, hydrogen peroxide, trimethylsilanol, and camphor) and characterized by NMR and GC-MS."
        3. **Sufficiency Check:**
            - **Action (Illustrates):** **Supported**. The action in the antecedent (preparing and characterizing five distinct compounds) provides a direct logical basis for the framing verb "illustrates."
            - **Concept (The power of &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR):** **Supported**. The antecedent explicitly states that the characterization was performed by "NMR." Demonstrating this on five different compounds is a direct textual support for the "power" of the technique.
            - **Scope Modifier (In the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups):** **Supported**. The antecedent states that &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled compounds were "prepared from" &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled water, which implies reactions involving oxygen. It also states they were "characterized by NMR." This directly supports the idea of using NMR to detect the results of reactions involving oxygen-containing groups.
    - **Conclusion:** The pronoun "This" is **NOT VAGUE**. Its antecedent in the preceding sentence provides explicit textual support for all key semantic components of the pronoun's context.
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from the previous sentence. Sentence 5 provides a specific finding (characterization of five compounds), and Sentence 6 presents the broader implication or conclusion drawn from that finding.

---

#### **Processing Sentence 7:** "Finally, an unexpected exchange reaction of primary alcohol moieties with water, facilitated by ketones, was detected by &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR."

- **Pronoun Reference Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence.
- **Flow Analysis:** Smooth transition from the previous sentence. The use of "Finally" clearly signals the last point in the summary. The sentence presents another key finding, continuing the theme of results obtained using &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR.

## **Full Text of Identified 'Conclusions' Section:**

> An inexpensive, straightforward method for enriching &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled water from tap water and the subsequent preparation of &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled hydrogen peroxide from electrolysis of H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O are described in this paper. The fractional distillation method for enrichment of H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O reported here can greatly enrich the percentage of H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O or H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>18&lt;/sup>O which are both useful for isotope studies. From approximately 500 mL of 40-fold enriched water, about 90 mL of H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O was obtained. The most practical method for determining the enrichment was found to be the reaction of the H&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O with BSTFA to yield hexamethyldisiloxane which was quantified by GC-MS analysis. Five other &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled compounds were also prepared from the &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O-labeled water (sodium hydroxide, 1-hexanol, hydrogen peroxide, trimethylsilanol, and camphor) and characterized by NMR and GC-MS. This illustrates the power of &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups. Finally, an unexpected exchange reaction of primary alcohol moieties with water, facilitated by ketones, was detected by &lt;sup>17&lt;/sup>O NMR.
