> An inexpensive, straightforward method for enriching 17O-labeled water from tap water and the subsequent preparation of 17O-labeled hydrogen peroxide from electrolysis of H2 17O are described in this paper. The fractional distillation method for enrichment of H2 17O reported here can greatly enrich the percentage of H2 17O or H2 18O which are both useful for isotope studies. From approximately 500 mL of 40-fold enriched water, about 90 mL of H2 17O was obtained. The most practical method for determining the enrichment was found to be the reaction of the H2 17O with BSTFA to yield hexamethyldisiloxane which was quantified by GC-MS analysis. Five other 17O-labeled compounds were also prepared from the 17O-labeled water (sodium hydroxide, 1-hexanol, hydrogen peroxide, trimethylsilanol, and camphor) and characterized by NMR and GC-MS. This illustrates the power of 17O NMR in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups.

| **2 – Antecedent Identification (within Sentences 1-5)** | Closest plausible antecedent: Sentence 5, which reports preparation and characterization of five 17O-labeled compounds by NMR and GC-MS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **3 – Sufficiency Check vs. Pronoun Context**            | • **Action (“illustrates”):** *Supported* – preparing and analysing multiple compounds can serve as evidence. <br>• **Object – “power of 17O NMR”**: *Not Explicitly Supported* – Sentence 5 mentions “NMR,” but not specifically **17O NMR** or its “power.” <br>• **Scope – “detection of reactions of O-containing functional groups”**: *Not Explicitly Supported* – earlier sentences discuss enrichment and analysis, but none explicitly describe detecting functional-group reactions. |
| **Conclusion**                                           | Because key semantic components (explicit reference to **17O NMR** and to detecting reactions) are not textually present in the antecedent, **“This” is vague under Constraint 4**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

* **Flow Note:** Transition idea is logical, but pronoun vagueness may momentarily obscure the link to preceding content.

### Processing Sentence 7

**Sentence:** *Finally, an unexpected exchange reaction … was detected by 17O NMR.*

* **Pronoun Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified.
* **Flow Note:** Smooth transition—“Finally” clearly signals closing remark while adding a new observation consistent with the analytical theme.

---

**Summary of Pronoun Issues:** Only Sentence 6 contains a standalone demonstrative pronoun (*This*) whose antecedent lacks explicit textual support for all components of its meaning, rendering it **vague/ambiguous** within the self-contained *Conclusions* section. All other sentences are free of pronoun-reference problems, and overall sentence-to-sentence flow remains smooth.

### Processing Sentence 6:

**"This illustrates the power of 17O NMR in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups."**

* **Pronoun Reference Analysis:**

  * **Pronoun:** "This"

  #### Pronoun Context Definition:

  * **Action:** Illustrates
  * **Concept:** Power of 17O NMR
  * **Subject of Concept:** In detection of O-containing functional group reactions

  #### Antecedent Identification:

  * Most plausible antecedent: The entire preceding sentence (Sentence 5): the preparation and characterization of five 17O-labeled compounds.

  #### Sufficiency Check:

  * **Action (Illustrates):** Supported — the act of preparing and characterizing labeled compounds directly supports illustrating the utility of a method.
  * **Concept (Power of 17O NMR):** Partially supported — the sentence mentions NMR characterization but does not explicitly elaborate on its "power".
  * **Subject (Detection of reactions of O-containing functional groups):** Partially supported — some compounds listed contain oxygen, but explicit "detection of reactions" isn't detailed in that sentence.

  ✅ **Conclusion:**
  **Ambiguity Status:** **Marginally ambiguous.** The antecedent covers experimental results but doesn’t **explicitly** contain all semantic components (e.g., detection of reactions) needed to fully support the pronoun context. The link is **suggestive** rather than fully explicit.

* **Flow Note:** Smooth transition from previous sentence, though a clearer referent could improve precision.

* **Flow Note:** Logical extension, demonstrating additional applications of the enriched water.

### Processing Sentence 6

*Sentence:* “**This** illustrates the power of 17O NMR in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups.”

**Pronoun Reference Analysis**

1. **Pronoun:** “This”
2. **Pronoun-Context Definition**

   * **Verb:** illustrates
   * **Direct object phrase (head noun & modifiers):** “the **power** \[head] **of 17O NMR** \[prep. phrase] **in the detection of the reactions of O‐containing functional groups** \[prep. phrase]”
3. **Antecedent Identification (searching Sentences 1-5):** The most specific candidate is the entire preceding accomplishment described in Sentence 5: preparation and NMR/GC-MS characterization of five 17O-labeled compounds.
4. **Sufficiency Check**

   | Pronoun-Context Component                                    | Explicitly Supported by Antecedent Text? | Notes                                                                                                   |

   | **Action (illustrates)**                                     | **Supported**                            | Demonstrative evidence is implied by successful preparation/characterization.                           |
   | **Power of 17O NMR**                                         | **Not Explicitly Supported**             | Sentence 5 states “characterized by **NMR**,” but does **not** specify **17O NMR** nor mention “power.” |
   | **Detection of reactions of O-containing functional groups** | **Not Explicitly Supported**             | Sentence 5 speaks of characterization, not detection of reactions.                                      |
5. **Result:** Because two critical semantic components lack explicit textual support, the antecedent fails Constraint 4. **“This” is therefore vague/ambiguous within the local confines of the Conclusions section.**

* **Flow Note:** Transition is conceptually reasonable (moving from results to broader significance) but the vague antecedent weakens clarity.

### Processing Sentence 7

*Sentence:* “Finally, an unexpected exchange reaction of primary alcohol moieties with water, facilitated by ketones, was detected by 17O NMR.”

* **Pronoun analysis:** No standalone pronouns.
* **Flow Note:** Smooth—marks a concluding observation that logically follows the demonstration in Sentences 5-6.

---

### Summary of Pronoun Issues

Only one pronoun (“This” in Sentence 6) fails the strict antecedent sufficiency test and should be revised to a concrete noun phrase (e.g., “The successful preparation and NMR characterization of five additional 17O-labeled compounds illustrates …”) to eliminate ambiguity.
