> An inexpensive, straightforward method for enriching 17O-labeled water from tap water and the subsequent preparation of 17O-labeled hydrogen peroxide from electrolysis of H2 17O are described in this paper. The fractional distillation method for enrichment of H2 17O reported here can greatly enrich the percentage of H2 17O or H2 18O which are both useful for isotope studies. From approximately 500 mL of 40-fold enriched water, about 90 mL of H2 17O was obtained. The most practical method for determining the enrichment was found to be the reaction of the H2 17O with BSTFA to yield hexamethyldisiloxane which was quantified by GC-MS analysis. Five other 17O-labeled compounds were also prepared from the 17O-labeled water (sodium hydroxide, 1-hexanol, hydrogen peroxide, trimethylsilanol, and camphor) and characterized by NMR and GC-MS. This illustrates the power of 17O NMR in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups.

| **2 – Antecedent Identification (within Sentences 1-5)** | Closest plausible antecedent: Sentence 5, which reports preparation and characterization of five 17O-labeled compounds by NMR and GC-MS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **3 – Sufficiency Check vs. Pronoun Context**            | • **Action (“illustrates”):** *Supported* – preparing and analysing multiple compounds can serve as evidence. <br>• **Object – “power of 17O NMR”**: *Not Explicitly Supported* – Sentence 5 mentions “NMR,” but not specifically **17O NMR** or its “power.” <br>• **Scope – “detection of reactions of O-containing functional groups”**: *Not Explicitly Supported* – earlier sentences discuss enrichment and analysis, but none explicitly describe detecting functional-group reactions. |
| **Conclusion**                                           | Because key semantic components (explicit reference to **17O NMR** and to detecting reactions) are not textually present in the antecedent, **“This” is vague under Constraint 4**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

* **Flow Note:** Transition idea is logical, but pronoun vagueness may momentarily obscure the link to preceding content.

### Processing Sentence 7

**Sentence:** *Finally, an unexpected exchange reaction … was detected by 17O NMR.*

* **Pronoun Analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified.
* **Flow Note:** Smooth transition—“Finally” clearly signals closing remark while adding a new observation consistent with the analytical theme.

---

**Summary of Pronoun Issues:** Only Sentence 6 contains a standalone demonstrative pronoun (*This*) whose antecedent lacks explicit textual support for all components of its meaning, rendering it **vague/ambiguous** within the self-contained *Conclusions* section. All other sentences are free of pronoun-reference problems, and overall sentence-to-sentence flow remains smooth.

### Processing Sentence 6:

**"This illustrates the power of 17O NMR in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups."**

* **Pronoun Reference Analysis:**

  * **Pronoun:** "This"

  #### Pronoun Context Definition:

  * **Action:** Illustrates
  * **Concept:** Power of 17O NMR
  * **Subject of Concept:** In detection of O-containing functional group reactions

  #### Antecedent Identification:

  * Most plausible antecedent: The entire preceding sentence (Sentence 5): the preparation and characterization of five 17O-labeled compounds.

  #### Sufficiency Check:

  * **Action (Illustrates):** Supported — the act of preparing and characterizing labeled compounds directly supports illustrating the utility of a method.
  * **Concept (Power of 17O NMR):** Partially supported — the sentence mentions NMR characterization but does not explicitly elaborate on its "power".
  * **Subject (Detection of reactions of O-containing functional groups):** Partially supported — some compounds listed contain oxygen, but explicit "detection of reactions" isn't detailed in that sentence.

  ✅ **Conclusion:**
  **Ambiguity Status:** **Marginally ambiguous.** The antecedent covers experimental results but doesn’t **explicitly** contain all semantic components (e.g., detection of reactions) needed to fully support the pronoun context. The link is **suggestive** rather than fully explicit.

* **Flow Note:** Smooth transition from previous sentence, though a clearer referent could improve precision.

   | **Power of 17O NMR**                                         | **Not Explicitly Supported**             | Sentence 5 states “characterized by **NMR**,” but does **not** specify **17O NMR** nor mention “power.” |
   | **Detection of reactions of O-containing functional groups** | **Not Explicitly Supported**             | Sentence 5 speaks of characterization, not detection of reactions.                                      |
5. **Result:** Because two critical semantic components lack explicit textual support, the antecedent fails Constraint 4. **“This” is therefore vague/ambiguous within the local confines of the Conclusions section.**

* **Flow Note:** Transition is conceptually reasonable (moving from results to broader significance) but the vague antecedent weakens clarity.

### Processing Sentence 7

*Sentence:* “Finally, an unexpected exchange reaction of primary alcohol moieties with water, facilitated by ketones, was detected by 17O NMR.”

* **Pronoun analysis:** No standalone pronouns.
* **Flow Note:** Smooth—marks a concluding observation that logically follows the demonstration in Sentences 5-6.

### Summary of Pronoun Issues

Only one pronoun (“This” in Sentence 6) fails the strict antecedent sufficiency test and should be revised to a concrete noun phrase (e.g., “The successful preparation and NMR characterization of five additional 17O-labeled compounds illustrates …”) to eliminate ambiguity.

| **Vagueness/Ambiguity Verdict** | **Vague pronoun** – Antecedent fails to explicitly satisfy multiple key context components (Subject and Condition).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

**Flow Note:** Transition is partially weak: introduces the evaluative statement “This illustrates …”, but necessary explicit link (“17O NMR” and reaction-detection context) is missing, causing a mild disconnect.

### Processing Sentence 7

**Pronoun analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence.
**Flow Note:** Smooth—extends the discussion with a final, specific finding; logically follows illustrative remark, although topic shifts from general capability to a particular reaction.

   * **Action:** illustrates
   * **Concept:** the power
   * **Subject of power:** 17O NMR
   * **Scope Modifier:** in detecting reactions of O-containing functional groups

2. **Antecedent Identification**
   *Most specific plausible antecedent*: Sentence 5 (“Five other 17O-labeled compounds … characterized by NMR and GC-MS”).

3. **Sufficiency Check**

   | Pronoun-context component                                        | Supported by antecedent?     | Notes                                                                                     |
   | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | Action (illustrates)                                             | **Not explicitly supported** | Antecedent describes *preparation/characterization*, not an act that *illustrates* power. |
   | Concept (power)                                                  | Not explicitly named         | No wording about “power” appears.                                                         |
   | Subject (17O NMR)                                                | **Partially**                | Antecedent mentions “NMR” but not specifically “17O NMR”.                                 |
   | Scope (detection of reactions of O-containing functional groups) | **Not supported**            | Antecedent lists compounds, not reaction detection.                                       |

   **Result:** Antecedent fails to satisfy multiple required components; therefore, the pronoun *This* is **vague/ambiguous** under Constraint 4.

Flow Note: Slightly abrupt—sentence leaps from compound characterization (Sentence 5) to a generalized claim about 17O NMR’s diagnostic power without fully sign-posting the link.

### Processing Sentence 7

*No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence.*
Flow Note: Smooth culmination; sentence adds a specific illustrative finding, linking logically to the generalized claim in Sentence 6.

---

**Summary of Pronoun Issues:**
Only Sentence 6 contains a standalone demonstrative pronoun (*This*) whose antecedent within the Conclusions section is underspecified, causing potential ambiguity for readers.

| **Vagueness Verdict**                                 | **Vague / ambiguous.** The antecedent lacks explicit language matching the evaluative concept “power” and the specific scope of “detection of reactions,” so “This” does not have fully supported antecedent context.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

*Flow Note:* Transition is conceptually sensible, but the evaluative summary introduced by “This” relies on implicit inference, making the link moderately weak.

---

### Processing Sentence 7

**Sentence:** “Finally, an unexpected exchange reaction of primary alcohol moieties with water, facilitated by ketones, was detected by 17O NMR.”
*Pronoun analysis:* No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified.
*Flow Note:* Uses “Finally” as an explicit connector—smooth wrap-up of findings.

---

**Summary of Pronoun Issues:**
Only the demonstrative pronoun **“This”** in Sentence 6 is flagged as vague because the preceding text does not explicitly supply all semantic components (especially the evaluative notion of “power” and the specific scope of reaction detection) required to fully anchor its meaning. All other sentences either lack standalone pronouns or use relative pronouns with clear, local antecedents.

**Result:** Because three of the four semantic components lack explicit support, \*\*“This” is **vague/ambiguous** under Constraint 4.

**Flow Note:** Transition is somewhat abrupt; vague “This” refers back to prior results without clearly specifying which finding demonstrates NMR’s “power,” slightly disrupting cohesion.

* **Pronoun analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified.
* **Flow Note:** Smooth elaboration on enrichment methodology from Sentence 1.

---

### Processing Sentence 3

> *“From approximately 500 mL … was obtained.”*

* **Pronoun analysis:** None.
* **Flow Note:** Continues quantitatively from preceding method; smooth.

---

### Processing Sentence 4

> *“The most practical method … GC-MS analysis.”*

* **Pronoun analysis:** Relative pronouns “which” have explicit in-sentence antecedents (“hexamethyldisiloxane”) and thus fall outside the scope of standalone pronoun analysis.
* **Flow Note:** Logical follow-on—moves from enrichment to measurement; smooth.

---

### Processing Sentence 5

> *“Five other 17O-labeled compounds … NMR and GC-MS.”*

* **Pronoun analysis:** None.
* **Flow Note:** Expands on applications; transition is smooth.

---

### Processing Sentence 6

> *“This illustrates the power of 17O NMR in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups.”*

**Candidate Pronoun :** “**This**”

1. **Pronoun Context Definition**

   * **Verb (Action):** illustrates
   * **Direct-object phrase (Concept):** the power of 17O NMR
   * **Head noun:** power
   * **Modifiers:** “of 17O NMR” and “in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups”

2. **Antecedent Identification (within earlier Conclusions sentences):**
   The most plausible antecedent is Sentence 5, describing the preparation and NMR characterization of five 17O-labeled compounds.

3. **Sufficiency Check (Constraint 4)**

| Pronoun-context component         | Supported by antecedent text? | Notes                                                                                                    |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Action – illustrates**          | **Supported**                 | Characterizing multiple compounds could indeed “illustrate” something.                                   |
| **Concept – power of 17O NMR**    | **Not Explicitly Supported**  | Antecedent states compounds were “characterized by NMR,” but does not refer to “power” or effectiveness. |
| **Modifier – in the detection …** | **Not Explicitly Supported**  | Antecedent mentions characterization, not “detection of reactions of O-containing functional groups.”    |

**Result:** Because key modifiers and the specific concept are **not explicitly present**, the pronoun **“This” is vague/ambiguous** under the task’s strict constraints.

* **Flow Note:** Although semantically intended as a summary, the pronoun’s vagueness slightly weakens cohesion; nevertheless, the thematic flow from Sentence 5 to 6 remains generally smooth.

---

### Processing Sentence 7

> *“Finally, an unexpected exchange reaction … was detected by 17O NMR.”*

* **Pronoun analysis:** None.
* **Flow Note:** The adverb “Finally” signals a concluding aside yet still relates to NMR applications; transition is smooth.

*No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence (relative pronoun “which” refers unambiguously to “hexamethyldisiloxane”).*
Flow Note: Smooth transition—continues procedural description of enrichment verification.

#### Processing Sentence 5

*No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence.*
Flow Note: Smooth—extends the discussion to additional compounds derived from the enriched water.

#### Processing Sentence 6

> **Sentence 6:** “This illustrates the power of 17O NMR in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups.”

**Candidate Pronoun:** *This*

**Pronoun Context Definition**

| Component                     | Extracted meaning                                                              |

| **Direct object (head noun)** | the power                                                                      |
| **Key modifiers**             | of 17O NMR ; in the detection (of reactions of O-containing functional groups) |

**Antecedent Identification**
Most plausible antecedent = Sentence 5 (“Five other 17O-labeled compounds were also prepared … and characterized by NMR and GC-MS.”)

**Sufficiency Check**

| Pronoun-context component                                    | Explicitly supported in Sentence 5?                                                                                                  | Status |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ |
| **Action (illustrates)**                                     | Preparation & characterization could *demonstrate* something → **Supported**                                                         |        |
| **Power of 17O NMR**                                         | Sentence 5 mentions “NMR” but **not** “17O NMR” or its “power” → **Not Explicitly Supported**                                        |        |
| **Detection of reactions of O-containing functional groups** | Sentence 5 lists compound preparation & characterization, but **does not mention reaction detection** → **Not Explicitly Supported** |        |

Because key modifiers (“17O NMR” and the specific *detection* role) lack explicit textual backing, the pronoun *This* fails Constraint 4 and is **vague/ambiguous** within the local context.

Flow Note: Transition is generally logical (drawing a summary point), but the vague “This” weakens clarity.

#### Processing Sentence 7

*No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence.*
Flow Note: Smooth—introduces the final, unexpected finding and naturally concludes the section.

---

**Summary of Issues Found**

* The only problematic pronoun is **“This”** in Sentence 6; its antecedent does not fully satisfy the strict sufficiency test, making the reference potentially ambiguous for readers restricted to the Conclusions text itself.
* Overall sentence-to-sentence flow is smooth, with the narrative progressing method → enrichment extent → verification → applications → summary illustration → final observation.

## Linguistic Flow and Pronoun Reference Analysis:

### Processing Sentence 1

**Pronoun check:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence.
**Flow Note:** N/A (first sentence).

---

### Processing Sentence 2

**Pronoun check:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence (relative **“which”** has an explicit local antecedent *H2 17O or H2 18O*).
**Flow Note:** Smooth transition from Sentence 1 (continues discussion of enrichment methods).

---

### Processing Sentence 3

**Pronoun check:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence.
**Flow Note:** Smooth, quantitative elaboration on the enrichment described in Sentence 2.

---

### Processing Sentence 4

**Pronoun check:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified (relative **“which”** unambiguously refers to *hexamethyldisiloxane*).
**Flow Note:** Logical progression—moves from obtaining enriched water to measuring its enrichment.

---

### Processing Sentence 5

**Pronoun check:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified.
**Flow Note:** Smooth extension—lists additional compounds prepared from enriched water.

---

### Processing Sentence 6

**Pronoun identified:** **“This”**

1. **Pronoun Context Definition**

   * **Action:** illustrates
   * **Concept illustrated:** the power
   * **Subject of power:** 17O NMR
   * **Scope/Modifier:** in the detection of the reactions of O-containing functional groups

2. **Antecedent Identification**
   *Most plausible antecedent:* Sentence 5 (preparation and NMR characterization of five 17O-labeled compounds).

3. **Sufficiency Check**

| Pronoun-context component                                        | Explicitly present in antecedent text?               | Status                       |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Action basis (something that can “illustrate”)                   | Preparing & characterizing compounds → **Supported** |                              |
| Concept “power” of 17O NMR                                       | Only “NMR” (unspecified nucleus) mentioned           | **Not Explicitly Supported** |
| Subject “17O NMR”                                                | Antecedent lacks the qualifier “17O”                 | **Not Explicitly Supported** |
| Scope “detection of reactions of O-containing functional groups” | No mention of detecting reactions                    | **Not Explicitly Supported** |

**Verdict:** The pronoun **“This”** is **vague/ambiguous** because its antecedent does not explicitly supply the key semantic components (specific reference to *17O NMR* and its *detective power for O-functional-group reactions*) required by the pronoun context.

**Flow Note:** Mild disruption—shift from listing experimental outputs (Sentence 5) to a meta-statement about NMR’s capability without explicit connective detail.

---

### Processing Sentence 7

**Pronoun check:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence.
**Flow Note:** Smooth—“Finally” appropriately signals a closing observation that elaborates on the phenomenon hinted at in Sentence 6.

---

### Summary of Pronoun Issues

* **Sentence 6** contains a vague demonstrative pronoun **“This”** whose antecedent is underspecified within the *Conclusions* text.
* All other sentences either lack standalone pronouns or use relative pronouns with clear local antecedents.

### Processing Sentence 7

**Sentence:** “Finally, an unexpected exchange reaction … was detected by 17O NMR.”

* **Pronoun analysis:** No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified.
* **Flow Note:** Uses “Finally” to mark closing insight; transition from Sentence 6 is smooth despite earlier pronoun vagueness.

| **Sufficiency Check**          | <br>• **Action (illustrates):** *Partially supported*—successful preparation & characterization could serve as evidence.<br>• **Concept (power of 17O NMR):** *Not explicitly supported*—Sentence 5 only mentions “NMR,” not its “power.”<br>• **Subject of Detection (17O NMR):** Only implicit; antecedent lists “NMR” generally, lacking the explicit qualifier “17O.”<br>• **Condition/Scope (detection of O-containing functional-group reactions):** *Not supported*—Sentence 5 lists compounds but does not mention reaction detection.<br><br>**Verdict:** The pronoun **“This”** is **vague/ambiguous** because the antecedent text fails to explicitly support key semantic components (especially “power” and the specific detection context). |
| **Flow Note**                  | Transition is conceptually acceptable (moving from results to broader significance) but weakened by the vague pronoun reference, which may momentarily disrupt clarity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

#### Processing Sentence 7

*No standalone pronouns requiring antecedent analysis identified in this sentence.*
*Flow Note:* Smooth wrap-up; sentence adds an unexpected finding that logically follows the significance statement in Sentence 6.

**Overall Observation:** The *Conclusions* section generally maintains a clear, logical flow, but Sentence 6 contains an ambiguous demonstrative pronoun whose antecedent does not fully satisfy the strict local-context criteria, slightly hindering precision.
