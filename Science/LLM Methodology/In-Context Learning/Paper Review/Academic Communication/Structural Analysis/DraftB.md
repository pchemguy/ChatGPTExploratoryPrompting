# **Ai-Facilitated Analysis of Abstracts and Conclusions: Flagging No New Information and Ambiguous Pronouns**

## 1. **Introduction**

Computer-assisted tools for academic writing have a long history [1], but the recent emergence of state-of-the-art (SOTA) large language models (LLMs) has enabled new forms of accessible semantic and linguistic analysis [5, 6] and synthesis [7]. Modern LLM architectures, such as Gemini Pro 2.5 Pro [2], ChatGPT Plus o3 [3], and Claude Opus 4 [4], possess capabilities that are particularly useful for the semantic and structural analysis of technical texts. Specifically, their large context windows allow for the analysis of full-length research papers [8, 9], while in-context learning (ICL) [11–13] combined with advanced prompting strategies [14–22] makes it possible to systematically focus the model's attention on specialized aspects of a manuscript [8, 9].

Many scholarly publications that report original research follow the IMRaD (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion) structure [#]. Two other critical sections, the Abstract and the Conclusions, serve as academic summaries that frame this main body of work. This study focuses on the semantic and linguistic quality of these two summary sections. We propose an LLM-based workflow to diagnose two common issues that can detract from the clarity and integrity of these summaries: the inclusion of information not substantiated in the main text and the use of ambiguous pronoun constructs.

Both of these issues undermine the core function of a scholarly manuscript: the effective communication of scientific information. Scientists generally expect that all factual claims within a summary must originate from and be substantiated by the IMRaD content of the paper [#], where proper context is provided. Introducing new information in a summary section either deprives that information of necessary context or undermines the communicative function of the summary itself. Similarly, ambiguous pronouns (e.g., "it" or a standalone "this") can disrupt narrative flow and complicate comprehension by obscuring the intended antecedent (\<quote here\>) [#]. To address these problems, we developed and tested a series of proof-of-concept (PoC) prompts designed to guide an LLM in identifying and flagging these specific issues within a sample text [33]. The prompts and our development process are detailed in the appendices and supporting information.
