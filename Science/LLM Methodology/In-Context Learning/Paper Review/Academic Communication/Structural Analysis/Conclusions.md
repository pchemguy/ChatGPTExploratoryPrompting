Quote Conclusions section

---

Now I need you to convert Conclusions into a numebred list of points, each containing a single fact, going strictly in the order they appear in Conclusions.

Important, do not generate a new text. Each point must be a sentence or sentence fragment taken exactly as it appears in the source text.

---

Go through each point again and classify its content as
- Background / research question / hypothesis / objective / problem statement (unmet need, gap this research is trying to fill)
- Main claimed result
- Important subsidiary finding or outcome
- Key methodology 
- Interpretation and Answer to Research Question
- Comparison with Existing Literature (Contextualization)
- Significance and Implications
- Limitations of the Study
- Future Directions/Perspectives
- Concluding Statement (Take-Home Message)
