Quote Conclusions section

---

Now I need you to convert Conclusions into a numbered list of points, each containing a single fact (piece of information), going strictly in the order they appear in Conclusions.

Important, do not generate a new text. Each point must be a sentence or sentence fragment taken exactly as it appears in the source text.

---

Go through each point again and classify its content as
- Background / research question / hypothesis / objective / problem statement (unmet need, gap this research is trying to fill)
- Main claimed result
- Key methodology 
- Important subsidiary finding or outcome
- Interpretation and Answer to Research Question
- Comparison with Existing Literature (Contextualization)
- Significance and Implications
- Limitations of the Study
- Future Directions/Perspectives
- Concluding Statement (Take-Home Message)

If a particular point ended up having more than a single piece of information, identify each piece of information and assign appropriate category.

Go through each point and identify any ambiguities

---

Go through each point and identify any vague/ambiguous pronouns. Consider that the antecedent of a pronoun within conclusions section MUST also be within conclusions section and MUST appear before this pronoun (a determiner modifying a closely following noun should not be flagged, if its use is standard, such as this paper/research/work). Taking this constraint into account, consider for each vague/ambiguous pronoun if its antecedent can be identified based on context, provided for such pronoun. Important: the context includes only the current sentence, that provides information related to the pronoun under consideration and preceding points within conclusion only.

---

Go through each point of the provided text (e.g., 'Conclusions section') and identify any pronouns that could be considered vague or ambiguous.

**When evaluating a pronoun for vagueness/ambiguity, apply the following strict constraints:**

1. **Antecedent Location:** The antecedent (the specific word(s) or concept the pronoun refers to) MUST be explicitly present as text within the provided section (e.g., 'Conclusions section') and MUST appear _before_ the pronoun in question.
2. **Determiners:** A determiner (e.g., "this," "that," "these," "those") modifying a closely following noun should _not_ cause the pronoun/determiner itself to be flagged as vague if the resulting noun phrase (e.g., "this paper," "this research," "this work") has a clear and standard meaning in the given context, even if the noun it modifies was not explicitly introduced in prior sentences of the section.
3. **Context for Antecedent Identification:** The context for identifying an antecedent is strictly limited to:
    - The sentence in which the pronoun appears.
    - The explicit text of the points or sentences that precede the pronoun _within the provided section only_.
4. **Sufficiency of Antecedent for Clarity (Crucial Rule):**
    - For a pronoun to be considered **not vague or ambiguous** for the purpose of this analysis, its identified antecedent (from the strictly defined preceding text within the section) must **explicitly and fully support all aspects of the statement in which the pronoun is used.**
    - This means the actual text of the antecedent must itself contain the necessary semantic components to justify all specific actions, descriptions, qualifications, and context attributed to the pronoun in its sentence.
    - **If the antecedent provides only general support, but the sentence containing the pronoun introduces more specific qualifications or actions that are not explicitly covered by the antecedent's text, then the pronoun MUST be flagged as vague or its reference deemed incompletely supported by the local textual antecedent.**
    - No information, details, or inferences from the broader document (outside the explicitly provided section being analyzed, e.g., from the main body of a paper if only the conclusions are provided for this task) may be used to bridge semantic gaps between the pronoun's usage and its textual antecedent within the section.

For each pronoun identified as vague or ambiguous according to these rules, explain precisely why (e.g., which part of the pronoun's sentence is not explicitly supported by the identified antecedent text) and discuss the extent to which its intended meaning can (or cannot) be inferred from the strictly defined local context.
