Quote Conclusions section

---

Now I need you to convert Conclusions into a numbered list of points, each containing a single fact (piece of information), going strictly in the order they appear in Conclusions.

Important, do not generate a new text. Each point must be a sentence or sentence fragment taken exactly as it appears in the source text.

---

Go through each point again and classify its content as
- Background / research question / hypothesis / objective / problem statement (unmet need, gap this research is trying to fill)
- Main claimed result
- Key methodology 
- Important subsidiary finding or outcome
- Interpretation and Answer to Research Question
- Comparison with Existing Literature (Contextualization)
- Significance and Implications
- Limitations of the Study
- Future Directions/Perspectives
- Concluding Statement (Take-Home Message)

If a particular point ended up having more than a single piece of information, identify each piece of information and assign appropriate category. 

---

Go through each point and identify any ambiguities

---

Go through each point and identify any vague/ambiguous pronouns. Consider that the antecedent of a pronoun within conclusions section MUST also be within conclusions section and MUST appear before this pronoun (a determiner modifying a closely following noun should not be flagged, if the context is clear). Taking this constraint into account, consider for each vague/ambiguous pronoun if its antecedent can be identified based on context, provided for such pronoun.
