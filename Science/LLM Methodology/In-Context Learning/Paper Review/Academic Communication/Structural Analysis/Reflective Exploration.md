- Identified issues (concrete/specific starting point):
    1. new information in conclusion
    2. ambiguous/vague “this” in conclusion 
- Issue types/classes/kinds/categories/nature (analyze, generalize):
    1. new information (conclusion vs IMRaD) - inconsistent information presenting / semantic issue; violation of generally accepted (by the target audience) practices and expected composition /design principles of specific type professional technical communication; complicates interpretation (summary by definition is a concise highlighting of key features, not a place to provide sufficient context to introduce new information with necessary details, linking it to the overall work, and discussing it) and/or undermines the main highlighting role of summary, if attempting to provide context for new information (specific detailed context is a clutter for a summary section).
    2. Ambiguous/vague pronouns, especially “it” and naked/standalone “this”, linguistic/semantic issue; such grammar constructs are inherently ambiguous / vague, disrupt flow and compression because of the additional grammatical/semantic analysis necessary to identify the reference’s antecedent; using naked “this” to encode meaning is often simpler precisely because of this construct’s flexible use, but if the author does not invest efforts into selecting unambiguous grammatical constructs and accurately articulating intended meaning, this burden is passed onto the reader, who will need need consider alternative meanings encompassed by the used sloppy construct’s flexibility during the reading/decoding part of the overall communication process.
- Immediate/local/specific context for the identified issues, context's qualification, key/functional role (analysis/context qualification to be used as the basis for generalization and lateral exploration):
    Conclusion section; key section of a manuscript, highlights/summarizes key features of the text, possibly provides hints that may bridge to future/subsequent/consequential/related work.
- Overarching/encompassing context based on the local context description (generalize/abstract)
    Academic manuscript
- Similar/related local contexts under the identified overarching context based on the local context qualification/functional role (lateral exploration):
    Abstract
