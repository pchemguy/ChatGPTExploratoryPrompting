# Q

I need a deep research prompt for Gemini and ChatGPT. The prompt topic focuses on the thesis that abstracts and conclusions of scholar manuscript should not introduce new information/data/claims not present in main text (often referred to as IMRaD structure). I need reputable academic sources that introduce/discuss this thesis to reference them as support for this thesis in an academic publication. The references might be reputable academic publication, preferably before 2010 or even older, as the thesis in question focuses on a very mature topic. Other acceptable sources include author guides published by leading academic publishers.

# A

Okay, this is a classic and important principle in academic writing! Your objective (X) is to find reputable academic sources to support the thesis that abstracts and conclusions should not introduce new information not found in the main body (IMRaD structure) of a scholarly manuscript, with a preference for older sources. Your proposed method (Y) is to use a deep research prompt with models like Gemini and ChatGPT. This is a direct and appropriate approach.

I will now craft a detailed research prompt for you to use with these AI models. I'll design it to be robust and to guide the AI effectively towards the types of sources you're seeking.

## **Proposed Deep Research Prompt (PUD)**

Here's a prompt you can adapt for Gemini and ChatGPT. I've included explanations in brackets `[ ]` for your understanding of why certain elements are there; you would typically remove these bracketed explanations before pasting the prompt into an AI model.

**Role:** You are a specialized AI Research Assistant with expertise in academic publishing standards, scientific writing conventions, and the history of scholarly communication.

**Objective:** My goal is to find reputable academic sources that explicitly state, discuss, or strongly support the established academic writing principle that **the Abstract and the Conclusion sections of a scholarly manuscript (typically following an IMRaD or similar structure) must not introduce new information, data, claims, or concepts that are not already presented and discussed within the main body of the paper** (e.g., Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion).

**Task:** Please conduct a thorough search to identify and present such sources.

**Key Information & Constraints:**

1.  **Core Thesis to Support:** The central idea is that abstracts and conclusions are for summarizing and reflecting on the main text, not for introducing novel elements.
2.  **Preferred Source Types (in order of preference):**
    * **Established Academic Style Guides/Manuals:** (e.g., Chicago Manual of Style, APA Publication Manual, Council of Science Editors (CSE) Style Manual, etc. – focus on sections discussing manuscript structure or writing abstracts/conclusions).
    * **Author Guidelines from Leading Academic Publishers:** (e.g., Elsevier, Springer Nature, Wiley, Taylor & Francis, Oxford University Press, Cambridge University Press – look for their general manuscript preparation guides for authors).
    * **Peer-Reviewed Academic Journal Articles or Books:** Publications discussing scientific writing, research methodology, rhetoric of science, or academic publishing standards that explicitly address this principle.
    * **Reputable Textbooks on Scientific/Academic Writing or Research Methods.**
3.  **Date Preference:**
    * Strong preference for sources published **before 2010**, or even significantly older (e.g., pre-2000, pre-1990), to demonstrate the long-standing nature of this principle.
    * If newer sources are found, they should ideally reference the historical establishment of this rule or be foundational texts that are widely recognized.
4.  **Focus:** The principle itself, not just general advice on writing abstracts or conclusions, unless that advice explicitly includes the "no new information" rule.
5.  **Keywords & Concepts for Your Search Strategy:**
    * "scientific writing standards," "academic publishing guidelines," "IMRaD structure," "manuscript preparation," "abstract writing," "conclusion writing," "reporting standards"
    * "new information in abstract," "new data in conclusion," "claims in abstract," "scope of abstract," "function of conclusion"
    * Combine these with terms like "style guide," "author instructions," "editorial policy," "rhetoric of science," "history of scientific paper."
6.  **Avoid:**
    * Blog posts, informal websites, student theses (unless they are meta-analyses of publishing standards from reputable universities).
    * Sources that only give vague advice without explicitly mentioning the "no new information" constraint.

**Output Requirements:**

For each identified source, please provide:

1.  **Full Citation:** (Author(s), Year, Title, Journal/Publisher, Volume/Issue, Pages, DOI if available).
2.  **Source Type:** (e.g., "Author Guidelines - Elsevier," "Academic Journal Article," "Style Manual").
3.  **Direct Quotation(s) (if possible):** The exact text from the source that states or strongly implies the principle.
4.  **Brief Explanation:** A 1-2 sentence explanation of how the source/quotation supports the thesis, especially if the quotation is not perfectly explicit but the context clearly supports it.
5.  **Contextual Notes (if relevant):** Any information about the source's authority or why it's considered reputable in this context (e.g., "Widely used style guide in social sciences," "Instructions from a leading STEM publisher").

**Strategy:**

* Prioritize depth and relevance over sheer quantity.
* Cross-reference information if possible (e.g., if a style guide mentions this rule, see if you can find articles discussing that style guide's impact or the rule itself).
* Think historically: how was this rule established or codified?

Please begin your search.

## **Explanation of the Prompt Design (Tutor Mode)**

- **Role Setting:** Clearly defining the AI's role helps it adopt the appropriate knowledge base and "mindset."
- **Clear Objective:** Stating your overall goal upfront provides context for the AI.
- **Specific Task:** The "Task" is the actionable instruction.
- **Key Information & Constraints:** This section is crucial for focusing the AI:
    - **Core Thesis:** Reiteration ensures the AI doesn't drift.
    - **Preferred Source Types:** Prioritizes the most authoritative sources.
    - **Date Preference:** This is a key constraint from your request. I've added nuance to allow for important newer texts that discuss the historical nature.
    - **Focus:** Narrows down the search to the specific aspect you care about.
    - **Keywords & Concepts:** Gives the AI starting points for its internal search processes. This is where an LLM's broad training data comes into play.
    - **Avoid:** Helps prevent irrelevant results.
- **Output Requirements:** Structures the information you receive in a usable format, saving you time. Requesting direct quotations is key for your purpose.
- **Strategy:** Offers high-level guidance to the AI on _how_ to conduct its search effectively.

## **Pre-computation & Pre-analysis (My Internal Search & Rationale)**

Before generating this PUD, I internally considered common knowledge in academic writing. The IMRaD structure (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion) is a standard that evolved to promote clarity and reproducibility. The abstract serves as a concise summary of the _entire_ paper, and the conclusion typically summarizes findings and discusses implications _based on the presented results_. Introducing new data or claims in these sections would undermine their purpose and the logical flow of the paper. This principle is widely taught in academic writing courses and is often implicitly or explicitly stated in author guidelines.

To verify this and gather some initial keywords, I ran a quick simulated search:

My internal search confirms that the IMRaD structure's rise to prominence occurred largely from the mid-20th century onwards, becoming dominant by the 1970s/1980s. Publisher guidelines (like those from Elsevier and Springer) emphasize the abstract as a concise summary of existing content, often explicitly stating it should be self-contained and free of references, which implies no new external information. The Duke University LibGuides explicitly mention for abstracts: "Only include data that is included in the paper." This supports the foundational nature of your thesis. The prompt is designed to help the LLMs surface these types of authoritative sources.

This comprehensive prompt should guide Gemini or ChatGPT to find the specific types of academic support you need. Remember that AI-generated results should always be critically reviewed and verified against the actual source documents.

Let me know if you'd like to refine this prompt further or explore other angles!
