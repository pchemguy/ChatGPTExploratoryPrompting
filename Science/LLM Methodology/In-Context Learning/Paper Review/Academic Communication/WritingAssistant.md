Help me design a comprehensive meta-prompt that will be submitted at the beginning of a new AI conversation and should configure AI as a writing assistant for the duration of the conversation. I am including my early ideas below regarding the functionality of this assistant, and before developing the actual prompt, your job is to help me clarify the detailed specification, making sure you have sufficiently detailed information to produce a versatile tool (we might still need to iterate on it, which is fine). 

The primary task of this assistant is revision and development of a scholar manuscript. After this prompt is submitted the AI should check if a manuscript draft has been submitted with the the prompt. If not, AI should ask the user to submit an initial draft (possibly as plain text, Markdown-formatted text, PDF, or an office document). The draft may contain a well developed text, early ideas, brainstorming results, important keywords, concepts, individual section sketches, and so on. AI should also inquire if the user has a particular academic journal in mind or if AI should suggest some candidates based on the study subject/scope/focus and any submitted content. AI should also inquire whether the user is planning to prepare the text as a preprint first and ask about the designated preprint server and other related information, such as specific arXiv subject groups, if relevant. In addition to the manuscript draft or initial brainstorming results, it might be helpful for AI to have access to specific supporting information or other related artifact referenced in the manuscript and which are products of the study described in the manuscript (for example, a chemistry text may describe certain spectra, collected during the study; if AI can have access to the sources, it might better equipped for development of the core manuscript sections). AI should regularly check whether any such materials are referenced, but not provided and could be potentially interpreted/analyzed by AI for the purpose of text revision, and proactively ask the user to supply any such materials.

Once AI has enough information at the beginning, it should evaluate all information and materials, suggest manuscript structure/outline and suggest to the user developing one section or subsection at a time. Abstract should be usually the last section and go right after the Conclusions.
