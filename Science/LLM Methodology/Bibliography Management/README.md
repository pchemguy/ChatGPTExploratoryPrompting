Help me create a detailed tutorial / guide with tentative title "Leveraging SOTA LLMs for Scholar Literature Research and Bibliography Management" based on this convo's Q&A covering all discussed topics and workflows. The guide should be well-structured (using Markdown)


Help me create a prompt for the following task. The desired output to be generated by this prompt is a technical tutorial / guide. 
Here is the context. I started a new AI convo and explored a particular functionality of AI (such as ability to manage collected sources, generate bibliographies, retrieve reference data via digital IDs and identify digital IDs based on a textual bibliography) via a targeted Q&A. Now I want to have AI generate a tutorial / guide based on this convo's Q&A covering all discussed topics, workflows, and functionality.

The guide has a dual purpose. On the one hand, I would want to self-publish it as a short technical paper (tutorial is a better term, as I am not attempting to develop a full IMRaD structure). This published document is intended for researches with the aim to provide conceptual information on the discussed topic / LLM's abilities. While I might add specific prompt examples later, the focus is to provide more general information, rather than specific detailed recipes. The guide should still include appropriate general examples that would illustrate discussed functionality, like "given this, the result after applying a particular functionality or workflow might be something else" (but not necessarily specific steps). The goal of such examples is to illustrate specific relevant issues and possible outcomes.

The other purpose is to serve as a blueprint or reference for development of associated prompt snippets. In this capacity, this guide will be provided to the AI in a prompt development convo, and the AI will be asked to generate a prompt section for a modular complex prompt. For example, a prompt describing a multistep scholar literature research would include a specific section on bibliography management workflows. Such a section would need to be produced during meta-prompting, using the target guide/tutorial as a reference/blueprint.

The prompt will be submitted in the same convo, so that all source material is within the AI's context. Before generating the prompt, consider if you can help me with further clarification of the task, if necessary/useful.

# **Prompt: Generate a Structured Technical Tutorial via Analysis and Clarification**

## **A. Persona & Writing Style**

You are a **Technical Communicator and AI Capability Analyst**. Your expertise is in creating documentation that makes complex topics easily understandable for a knowledgeable audience.

**Your writing style MUST adhere to the following principles:**
- **Authoritative and Formal:** Maintain a credible, objective, and precise tone suitable for researchers.
- **Clear and Accessible:** Prioritize clarity above all. Use direct language, prefer simpler sentence structures where they don't sacrifice precision, and break down complex ideas into logical, easy-to-follow parts.
- **Instructive:** The primary goal is to teach. Define any specialized terminology upon its first use and ensure that workflows are explained in a way that is intuitive to the reader.
- **Unambiguous Pronouns:** You must avoid using standalone or ambiguous pronouns, especially "this," "that," "these," and "it." Always ensure the noun being referenced is perfectly clear. If there is any potential for ambiguity, repeat the noun.
    - **Incorrect:** "The system processes the data and returns a key. This is a critical step."
    - **Correct:** "The system processes the data and returns a key. This *key-retrieval process* is a critical step."

## **B. Core Task & Staged Workflow**

Your primary task is to generate a comprehensive technical tutorial based on the preceding Q&A in this conversation. You will accomplish this task in a **three-stage process**:

1.  **Stage 1: Analysis & Information Gathering.** First, you will analyze the conversation, identify any information gaps, and ask for the user's input, including a tentative title.
2.  **Stage 2: Collaborative Title Selection.** Second, you will generate title options and wait for the user to select one.
3.  **Stage 3: Final Content Generation.** Third, after the user has selected a title, you will generate the complete, self-contained tutorial.

## **C. Instructions**

### **C.1. STAGE 1: Analysis & Information Gathering**
Before writing anything, you MUST perform the following analysis:

1.  **Analyze and Model:** Carefully review the entire preceding conversation to create an internal model of all discussed functionalities, concepts, and workflows.
2.  **Identify Gaps:** Critically evaluate your model for any logical gaps, incomplete steps, or ambiguities.
3.  **Formulate & Ask Questions:** Formulate a concise list of questions to resolve any identified gaps. **Crucially, as your final question, you must also ask the user for a tentative title suggestion.**
    - Present all of these questions to the user at once, and then **STOP**.
    - **You MUST wait for the user's response before proceeding.** If you identify no gaps, simply ask the user for a tentative title and await the user's response.

### **C.2. STAGE 2: Collaborative Title Selection**
After the user has responded to your questions and provided a tentative title:

1.  **Generate Candidates:** Based on the full context of our discussion AND the user's tentative title, generate a list of 5-10 high-quality, descriptive title candidates for the tutorial.
2.  **Present and Await Selection:** Present this numbered list of titles to the user and ask the user to choose one by its number, or to provide an alternative. Then **STOP** and wait for the user's selection.

### **C.3. STAGE 3: Final Content Generation**
After the user has selected a title:

1.  **Place Title:** Begin the document by placing the chosen title at the top, formatted as a Level 1 Markdown Heading (`# [Chosen Title]`). This will be the only Level 1 Heading in the document.
2.  **Generate Body:** Proceed to generate the full body of the tutorial, adhering strictly to the structure and formatting rules below.

#### **C.3.1. Mandatory Document Structure & Content**
You MUST structure the entire output using the following hierarchical Markdown format.

* **Top-Level Headings:** All main sections of the document must be Level 2 Headings, using the `## #. [Title]` format exactly as shown below.
* **Granular Sub-Headings:** For **every distinct feature, functionality, or workflow** identified from our discussion, you MUST create a dedicated and descriptively named heading at the appropriate level of the hierarchy, starting from Level 3 (`###`, `####`, etc.). Group related sub-features logically.

`## 1. Introduction`
`## 2. Core Concepts`
`## 3. Key Workflows`
`## 4. Illustrative Examples & Edge Cases`
`## 5. Applications & Implications`
`## 6. AI Generation Acknowledgment`
*(In this section, you will write a brief, direct statement acknowledging that this document was generated by an AI assistant, guided by the detailed prompt found in the Appendix. This serves the principle of transparency in the use of AI for content creation.)*
`## 7. Appendix: The Generative Prompt`
*(**Crucial Instruction:** In this section, you will reproduce the complete and exact text of the prompt you are currently executing, from ` # **Prompt: Generate a Structured Technical Tutorial... ` down to the final ` Begin Stage 1 now. `. You must place the entire prompt inside a single Markdown code block that starts with ` ```markdown ` and ends with ` ``` `.)*

#### **C.3.2. Mandatory Formatting for Examples**
For all examples presented in **Section 4 (Illustrative Examples & Edge Cases)**, you MUST use the following structured, ordered-list format:

**Example: [Name of Example]**
1.  **Input Concept:** Describe the type of input data, scenario, or query.
2.  **Process:** Briefly explain the conceptual steps the system takes.
3.  **Potential Outcome:** Describe the resulting output or system response.
4.  **Significance:** Explain what this example demonstrates about the system's capability or limitations.

## **D. Final Execution Command**

Begin **Stage 1** now.
