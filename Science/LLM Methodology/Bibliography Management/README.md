Help me create a detailed tutorial / guide with tentative title "Leveraging SOTA LLMs for Scholar Literature Research and Bibliography Management" based on this convo's Q&A covering all discussed topics and workflows. The guide should be well-structured (using Markdown)


Help me create a prompt for the following task. The desired output to be generated by this prompt is a technical tutorial / guide. 
Here is the context. I started a new AI convo and explored a particular functionality of AI (such as ability to manage collected sources, generate bibliographies, retrieve reference data via digital IDs and identify digital IDs based on a textual bibliography) via a targeted Q&A. Now I want to have AI generate a tutorial / guide based on this convo's Q&A covering all discussed topics, workflows, and functionality.

The guide has a dual purpose. On the one hand, I would want to self-publish it as a short technical paper (tutorial is a better term, as I am not attempting to develop a full IMRaD structure). This published document is intended for researches with the aim to provide conceptual information on the discussed topic / LLM's abilities. While I might add specific prompt examples later, the focus is to provide more general information, rather than specific detailed recipes. The guide should still include appropriate general examples that would illustrate discussed functionality, like "given this, the result after applying a particular functionality or workflow might be something else" (but not necessarily specific steps). The goal of such examples is to illustrate specific relevant issues and possible outcomes.

The other purpose is to serve as a blueprint or reference for development of associated prompt snippets. In this capacity, this guide will be provided to the AI in a prompt development convo, and the AI will be asked to generate a prompt section for a modular complex prompt. For example, a prompt describing a multistep scholar literature research would include a specific section on bibliography management workflows. Such a section would need to be produced during meta-prompting, using the target guide/tutorial as a reference/blueprint.

The prompt will be submitted in the same convo, so that all source material is within the AI's context. Before generating the prompt, consider if you can help me with further clarification of the task, if necessary/useful.

# **Prompt: Generate a Structured Technical Tutorial via Analysis and Clarification**

## **A. Persona & Writing Style**

You are a **Technical Communicator and AI Capability Analyst**. Your expertise is in creating documentation that makes complex topics easily understandable for a knowledgeable audience.

**Your writing style MUST adhere to the following principles:**
- **Authoritative and Formal:** Maintain a credible, objective, and precise tone suitable for researchers.
- **Clear and Accessible:** Prioritize clarity above all. Use direct language, prefer simpler sentence structures where they don't sacrifice precision, and break down complex ideas into logical, easy-to-follow parts.
- **Instructive:** The primary goal is to teach. Define any specialized terminology upon its first use and ensure that workflows are explained in a way that is intuitive to the reader.
- **Unambiguous Pronouns:** You must avoid using standalone or ambiguous pronouns, especially "this," "that," "these," and "it." Always ensure the noun being referenced is perfectly clear. If there is any potential for ambiguity, repeat the noun.
    - **Incorrect:** "The system processes the data and returns a key. This is a critical step."
    - **Correct:** "The system processes the data and returns a key. This *key-retrieval process* is a critical step."

## **B. Core Task & Staged Workflow**

Your primary task is to generate a comprehensive technical tutorial based on the preceding Q&A in this conversation. You will accomplish this task in a **two-stage process**:

1.  **Stage 1: Analysis & Clarification.** First, you will analyze the conversation, identify any information gaps, and ask me clarifying questions to fill them.
2.  **Stage 2: Content Generation.** Second, after I have answered your questions, you will generate the complete, self-contained tutorial.

## **C. Instructions**

### **C.1. STAGE 1: Pre-Generation Analysis & Clarification**

Before writing anything, you MUST perform the following analysis:

1.  **Analyze and Model:** Carefully review the entire preceding conversation. Identify and create an internal model of all discussed functionalities, concepts, and workflows related to the core topic.
2.  **Identify Gaps:** Critically evaluate your internal model for any logical gaps, incomplete steps in a workflow, ambiguous statements, or areas where a crucial detail seems to be missing.
3.  **Ask Clarifying Questions:**
    * If you identify any gaps, formulate a concise list of questions to me to resolve these ambiguities.
    * Present these questions to me and then **STOP**.
    * **You MUST wait for my response before proceeding.** If you identify no gaps, simply state that the analysis is complete and you are ready to proceed, then wait for my confirmation.

### **C.2. STAGE 2: Content Generation**

After I have responded to your clarifying questions (or confirmed that none are needed), you will proceed to generate the tutorial. You will incorporate my answers to create the most complete and accurate document possible.

### **C.3. Mandatory Document Structure & Content**

You MUST structure the entire output using the following hierarchical Markdown format.

* **Top-Level Headings:** Use the `#. [Title]` format exactly as shown below for the main sections.
* **Granular Sub-Headings:** For **every distinct feature, functionality, or workflow** identified from our discussion, you MUST create a dedicated and descriptively named heading (`##`, `###`, etc.) at the appropriate level of the hierarchy. Group related sub-features logically.

`# 1. Introduction`
*(Provide a brief, high-level overview of the capabilities discussed within the subject-matter domain of our conversation.)*

`# 2. Core Concepts`
*(Define and explain the fundamental concepts identified. Each key concept (e.g., a core entity, a relevant data format, a key principle) should have its own subheading.)*

`# 3. Key Workflows`
*(Detail the primary multi-step processes explored. Each workflow MUST be its own `##` subsection, with individual steps detailed under `###` subheadings if necessary.)*

`# 4. Illustrative Examples & Edge Cases`
*(Provide concrete, conceptual examples. Each example should illustrate a specific workflow or concept and have its own subheading.)*

`# 5. Applications & Implications`
*(Conclude with a forward-looking summary of how the functions and concepts discussed can be applied.)*

### **C.4. Mandatory Formatting for Examples**

For all examples presented in **Section 4 (Illustrative Examples & Edge Cases)**, you MUST use the following structured format to ensure clarity and future machine-parsability:

**Example: [Name of Example]**
- **Input Concept:** Describe the type of input data, scenario, or query.
- **Process:** Briefly explain the conceptual steps the system takes.
- **Potential Outcome:** Describe the resulting output or system response.
- **Significance:** Explain what this example demonstrates about the system's capability or limitations.

## **D. Final Execution Command**

Begin **Stage 1** now. Analyze the conversation and ask your clarifying questions, or state that none are needed and await my signal to proceed.
