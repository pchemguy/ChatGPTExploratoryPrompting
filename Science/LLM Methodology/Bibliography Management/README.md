Help me create a detailed tutorial / guide with tentative title "Leveraging SOTA LLMs for Scholar Literature Research and Bibliography Management" based on this convo's Q&A covering all discussed topics and workflows. The guide should be well-structured (using Markdown)


Help me create a prompt for the following task. The desired output to be generated by this prompt is a technical tutorial / guide. 
Here is the context. I started a new AI convo and explored a particular functionality of AI (such as ability to manage collected sources, generate bibliographies, retrieve reference data via digital IDs and identify digital IDs based on a textual bibliography) via a targeted Q&A. Now I want to have AI generate a tutorial / guide based on this convo's Q&A covering all discussed topics, workflows, and functionality. The guide has a dual purpose. On the one hand, I would want to self-publish it as a short technical paper (tutorial is a better term, as I am not attempting to develop a full IMRaD structure). This published document is intended for researches with the aim to provide conceptual information on the discussed topic / LLM's abilities. While I might add specific prompt examples later, the focus is to provide more general information, rather than specific detailed recipes. The guide should still include appropriate general examples that would illustrate discussed functionality, like "given this, the result after applying a particular functionality or workflow might be something else" (but not necessarily specific steps). The goal of such examples is to illustrate specific relevant issues and possible outcomes.

The prompt will be submitted in the same convo, so that all source material is within the AI's context. Before generating the prompt, consider if you can help me with further clarification of the task, if necessary/useful.
