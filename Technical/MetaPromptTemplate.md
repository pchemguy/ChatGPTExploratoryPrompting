# **Prompt Improvement Template**

Help me improve this ChatGPT prompt ("Prompt to be improved" below) to ensure it achieves the following objectives:

1. **Clarity of Task or Request:**   
    - Clearly communicate the intended task, question, or request to ChatGPT in a precise and unambiguous manner.
2. **Resolution of Ambiguities:**
    - Eliminate potential misunderstandings by providing all necessary context, details, and scope to support a relevant and specific response.
3. **Detailed Input:**
    - Include sufficient information to guide ChatGPT’s response effectively, minimizing the need for assumptions or misinterpretation.
4. **Encouragement for Clarification:**
    - Prompt ChatGPT to ask clarifying questions if the input is incomplete, unclear, or likely to lead to suboptimal results.
5. **Re-Reading and Reflection:**
    - Instruct ChatGPT to carefully re-read the prompt before answering, ensuring it identifies and reflects on issues that could impede a direct or meaningful response. These issues may include:
        - **False Premises or Factual Errors:**  
            Examples:
            - "Why are all cats black?" (Incorrect assumption)
            - "Who was the first person to land on Mars?" (Factually incorrect event)
        - **Logical Fallacies or Contradictions:**  
            Example: "What kind of triangle has two right angles?" (Geometric impossibility)
        - **Insufficient Details or Scope:**  
            Example: "Explain everything about physics." (Overly broad)
        - **Vague or Ambiguous Information:**  
            Example: "What is the best?" (Unclear criteria)
        - **Nonsensical Constructs:**  
            Example: "What is the square root of happiness?" (Conceptual inconsistency)
6. **Feedback on Problematic Questions:**
    - Instruct ChatGPT to provide constructive feedback or reflection on problematic aspects of the prompt instead of attempting to generate a direct answer when such issues are detected.

**Final Request:** Please ensure the improved version of this prompt is optimized to encourage thoughtful, structured, and actionable responses from ChatGPT. Provide feedback on whether this revised version meets the stated objectives or suggest further refinements to improve it.
