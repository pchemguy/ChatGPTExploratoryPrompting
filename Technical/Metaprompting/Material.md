# Meta Prompt for Prompt Rewriting

# Input 1

1. **Identify the Core Task:** First, the meta-prompt figures out what you want your Gem to do. Are you looking for a creative writing buddy, a data-crunching analyst, a code-generating whiz, or something else? This core task sets the stage for everything else.
2. **Extract Key Parameters:** Next, the meta-prompt puts on its detective hat and digs for clues. It’s looking for those juicy details that’ll shape your Gem’s output:
    - **Format:** Do you need a bulleted list, a paragraph, or a sonnet?
    - **Tone:** Should your Gem be playful, professional, or somewhere between?
    - **Length:** Are we talking about a tweet-sized response or a full-blown essay?
    - **Must-Haves:** Are there any essential elements that need to be included? URLs, statistics, specific keywords?
3. **Structure for Clarity:** Let’s be honest; sometimes, our prompts can be messy. But the meta-prompt is a neat freak! It loves to organize information, adding line breaks, bold headings, and numbered lists to make everything AI-friendly.
4. **Infer Implicit Instructions:** The meta-prompt has an uncanny ability to read between the lines. It might add a friendly greeting, helpful explanation, or even some background context you should have mentioned explicitly.
5. **Focus on “Gem-ifying”:** The meta-prompt isn’t just about improving a single prompt; it’s about creating a reusable, adaptable Gem that can shine in various situations. This means generalizing instructions and focusing on the task’s core goals, behaviors, and tone.

# Input 2

Analyze the user’s prompt and identify the following:
- **Core Task:** What is the primary objective?
- **Key Parameters:** What specific instructions or constraints are given?
- **Implicit Requirements:** Are there any unspoken expectations based on the task?

Transform the prompt by:
- **Structuring for Clarity:** Improve readability with formatting and organization.
- **Generalizing for Reusability:** Make the prompt applicable to a broader range of inputs.
- **Gemifying the Instructions:**
    - Add sections for “Purpose and Goals,” “Behaviors and Rules,” and “Overall Tone.”
    - Rephrase instructions as explicit, actionable steps for the Gem to follow.

Output the transformed prompt.

# Input 3

Analyze the user’s prompt and identify the following:
- **Core Task:** What is the primary objective the user wants to achieve?
- **Key Parameters:** What specific skills or knowledge should the LLM demonstrate?
- **User Needs:** What are the user’s likely expectations and desired outcomes?

Transform the prompt by:
- **Structuring for Clarity:** Improve readability with formatting and organization (headings, lists, etc.).
- **Generalizing for Reusability:** Make the prompt applicable to a broader range of user inputs within the same domain.
- **Gemifying the Instructions:**
    - Add sections for “Purpose and Goals”, “Behaviors and Rules”, and “Overall Tone”.
    - Rephrase instructions as explicit, actionable steps for Gemini to follow.
    - **Focus on interactive steps:** Include prompts for the LLM to ask questions, provide feedback, and engage in a dialogue with the user.\
    - **Break down tasks:** Divide broader actions into smaller, more specific sub-steps.
    - **Prioritize user needs:** Frame the rewritten prompt from the perspective of assisting and guiding the user.
    - **Define the desired tone:** Specify the overall tone and style of the LLM’s interactions (e.g., friendly, encouraging, collaborative).

Output the transformed prompt.
