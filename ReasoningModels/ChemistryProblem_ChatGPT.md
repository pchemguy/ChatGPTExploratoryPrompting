# Problem

Organic compound A has the molecular formula C5H8O. It decolorizes bromine water and forms a silver mirror when treated with ammoniacal silver oxide solution. Upon oxidation with KMnO4 in an acidic medium, compound A yields succinic acid. When heated with Wilkinson's catalyst (RhCl(PPh3)3), compound A undergoes isomerization to compound B. Compound B no longer reacts with bromine water or ammoniacal silver oxide solution. Oxidation of B with KMnO4 in an acidic medium yields glutaric acid. Write the mechanism for the transformation of A into B.

**Analysis of the problem**

1. **Empirical clues about Compound A ($\mathrm{C_{5}H_{8}O}$):**  
    - It *decolorizes bromine water* $\rightarrow$ it has a carbon–carbon double bond.  
    - It *gives a silver mirror* with Tollens’ reagent $\rightarrow$ it has an aldehyde group.  
    - On oxidation with $\mathrm{KMnO_4}$ (acidic), it gives *succinic acid* $\mathrm{HO_2C{-}CH_2{-}CH_2{-}CO_2H}$. Succinic acid has 4 carbons, implying that one carbon of the original $\mathrm{C_5}$ skeleton is lost as $\mathrm{CO_2}$ (or formic acid $\to$ $\mathrm{CO_2}$) during strong oxidative cleavage of the alkene.
2. **Likely structure of Compound A:**  
    A straightforward way to get a 4‐carbon diacid (succinic acid) from a 5‐carbon aldehyde/alkene is if the alkene is *terminal.* When a *terminal* alkene is cleaved by hot acidified $\mathrm{KMnO_4}$, the $\mathrm{CH_{2}=...}$ end is oxidized to $\mathrm{CO_2}$, and the rest (bearing the aldehyde) is oxidized to the 4‐carbon diacid.  
    
    In other words, a very plausible structure is **4‐pentenal**, conventionally written as  
    $$
    \mathrm{CH_2=CH{-}CH_2{-}CH_2{-}CHO}.
    $$
    - It has 5 carbons total.  
    - There is a terminal double bond (so it decolorizes $\mathrm{Br_2}$,  
    - A terminal aldehyde (so it gives Tollens’ test),  
    - Strong oxidation cleaves the $\mathrm{CH_2=}$ and oxidizes the aldehyde to carboxyl; net result is succinic acid ($\mathrm{HO_2C{-}CH_2{-}CH_2{-}CO_2H}$).  
3. **Clues about Compound B (isomerization product)**  
    - Heating A with *Wilkinson’s catalyst* $\bigl[\mathrm{RhCl(PPh_3)_3}\bigr]$ converts it into an isomer **B**.  
    - B *no longer* reacts with bromine water (no C=C) or with Tollens' (no aldehyde).  
    - Oxidation of B with $\mathrm{KMnO_4}$ gives *glutaric acid* ($\mathrm{HO_2C{-}(CH_2)_3{-}CO_2H}$), a 5‐carbon diacid.  
    - A compound with formula C₅H₈O that has *no double bonds* and *no aldehyde* but is easily oxidized to the 5‐carbon diacid is most naturally **cyclopentanone**.  
    - Indeed, strong oxidation of cyclopentanone can cleave the ring to give glutaric acid ($\mathrm{HO_2C{-}(CH_2)_3{-}CO_2H}$).

Putting all of that together:  
- **A** = 4‐pentenal ($\mathrm{CH_2=CH{-}CH_2{-}CH_2{-}CHO}$).  
- **B** = cyclopentanone ($\mathrm{C_5H_8O}$).

## The Transformation of 4-Pentenal into Cyclopentanone

### Overall Picture

Under the influence of a *transition‐metal catalyst* such as Wilkinson's catalyst $\bigl[\mathrm{RhCl(PPh_3)_3}\bigr]$, 4‐pentenal can **cyclize** to give cyclopentanone. This transformation is a classic example of an **intramolecular hydroacylation** (or *“ene”‐type) reaction*:
- The aldehyde C–H bond is effectively added across the C=C double bond in an intramolecular fashion,  
- forming a new C–C bond and converting the original aldehyde into a ketone ring.

### Simplified Arrow-Pushing (Organic) View

Although the full organometallic mechanism involves oxidative addition/reductive elimination steps at rhodium, the arrow‐pushing can be sketched in a more “textbook organic” manner as follows:
1. **Enol(ate) formation / “Ene” transition state.**  
    Under the Rh(I) catalyst, the aldehydic α‐hydrogen (the hydrogen on the formyl carbon) becomes activated.  We can think of partial enolization or a transition state where the aldehyde “H” and the alkene approach in a 1,5‐hydride shift arrangement (the so‐called *ene* reaction manifold).
2. **Concerted Intramolecular Addition (“6‐electron Ene Transition State”).**  
    A concerted shift of the aldehydic hydrogen onto the alkene, while the aldehyde carbon $\mathrm{C=O}$ and the alkene’s terminal carbon form a new C–C bond, creates a 5‐membered ring.  The immediate product is an enol (or alkoxide) intermediate.
3. **Tautomerization to the Ketone.**  
    The newly formed enol (or enolate) tautomerizes (proton shift) to give the **cyclopentanone** ring.  

Schematically:

```
   H                     H
   |                     |
CHO–CH2–CH2–CH=CH2  -->  \   /
    \                 +   C–C
     C=O                 /   \
```

where the net result is closure of a 5‐membered ring **and** conversion of the original aldehyde into a ketone.

### More "Organometallic" Mechanism

A more catalyst‐focused description (typical for Rh‐catalyzed hydroacylation) would be:
1. **Oxidative addition** of the aldehyde C–H bond to the Rh(I) center, forming a **rhodium–acyl–hydride** species.  
2. **Coordination** of the alkene to the metal, followed by **migratory insertion** of the alkene into either the Rh–H bond or the Rh–acyl bond (depending on the exact route).  
3. **Reductive elimination** from the metal center, forging the new C–C bond intramolecularly and releasing the 5‐membered ring ketone (cyclopentanone).  
4. The Rh(I) catalyst is regenerated to complete the cycle.
Either way, the net effect is to “add” the aldehyde C–H across the internal C=C bond to give a cyclized ketone.

## Final Answer (Mechanism Outline)

Below is a concise arrow‐pushing scheme one might present for the exam‐style solution.  (Numbering the carbons of 4‐pentenal from the **aldehyde** as C1 to the **terminal alkene** as C5 helps.)
1. **Formation of a transient Rh–hydride or partial enol**  
    $\mathrm{Rh(I)}$ interacts with the aldehydic proton (on C1).  
2. **Intramolecular addition**  
    - The C5 of the alkene attacks (or “inserts into”) the activated carbonyl carbon (C1).  
    - Simultaneously, the aldehydic hydrogen is transferred onto the $\mathrm{C4{-}C5}$ region (an *ene*‐type rearrangement).  
    - A **5‐membered ring** intermediate results (a hemiketal‐like or enolate‐like species bound to Rh).  
3. **Tautomerization / reductive elimination**  
    - Proton shifts (and/or reductive elimination from Rh) generate **cyclopentanone**.  
    - The Rh(I) species is regenerated.  

Since **cyclopentanone** has neither a C=C bond nor an aldehyde group, it no longer *decolorizes bromine* or *gives a silver mirror*.  And as the problem states, its oxidation leads to **glutaric acid** via ring cleavage.
