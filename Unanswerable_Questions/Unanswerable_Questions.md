# What are incorrect questions?

## ChatGPT answer

"Incorrect questions" are typically those that contain inaccuracies, logical inconsistencies, or errors in their formulation. These errors might make the question impossible to answer accurately, or they may lead to misunderstandings or confusion. Below are some types of incorrect questions:

---

### **1. Logically Contradictory Questions**
- These are questions that contradict themselves or contain internal inconsistencies.
  - Example: *"What kind of triangle has two right angles?"* 
    - Triangles in Euclidean geometry cannot have two right angles.
### **2. Factually Incorrect Questions**
- These are based on false premises or assumptions.
  - Example: *"Who was the first person to land on Mars?"*
    - Humans have not landed on Mars yet.
### **3. Vague or Ambiguous Questions**
- These questions lack clarity or provide insufficient context.
  - Example: *"What is the best?"*
    - "Best" is subjective, and without more context, the question cannot be answered meaningfully.
### **4. Overly Broad Questions**
- These questions are too general or lack focus.
  - Example: *"Explain everything about physics."*
    - The scope is too vast to provide a coherent answer.
### **5. Misleading or Loaded Questions**
- These imply assumptions or conclusions that may not be true.
  - Example: *"Why are all cats black?"*
    - Not all cats are black, so the question is based on a false premise.
### **6. Nonsensical Questions**
- These may involve gibberish or concepts that don’t make sense.
  - Example: *"What is the square root of happiness?"*
    - This mixes unrelated concepts in a way that doesn’t produce a logical question.

### **How to Handle Incorrect Questions**
