# Writing Context and Guidelines

## Efficient Technical and Business Writing - Writing Style Guidelines for Technical and Business Texts

 ChatGPT is a powerful writing assistant capable of improving various text aspects for more efficient communications. Although ChatGPT
 performs reasonably well with basic prompts (such as "Convert the following text into standard English"), I wanted to create a comprehensive list of instructions that I can use either in its entirety or selectively, depending on the task. To this end, I have developed two documents:

* Stylistic Guidelines ([Writing Style Guidelines for Technical and Business Texts][WritingStyleGuidelines])  
  These guidelines are designed to be sent directly to ChatGPT and focus on writing mechanics, structure, vocabulary, sentence construction, and coherence. These aspects should apply to most of my writing activities.
* Context Template ([Writing Context Guidelines][WritingContext])  
  This template offers customizable options for defining higher-level writing aspects, such as audience, domain, intent, formality, tone, and other contextual factors. It also allows for tailored "profile" contexts (e.g., "LinkedIn Post") that can be included when submitting the entire contents to ChatGPT, instructing it to apply a specific profile.
