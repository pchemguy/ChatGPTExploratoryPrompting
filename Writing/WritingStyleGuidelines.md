Ensure consistent mechanics throughout the text:
- **Spelling, Grammar, and Punctuation:**

  Avoid contractions unless required by context.

## **2. Vocabulary and Word Choice**

Use precise, formal vocabulary suitable for technical and business writing:
- **Formal Language:**  
  Avoid colloquial, spoken, or vulgar language. Use industry-appropriate terminology.
- **Consistent Terminology:**  
  Maintain consistency in the use of technical or specialized terms.
- **Appropriate Use of Abbreviations:**
    - Introduce abbreviations by spelling out the full term on first use, followed by the abbreviation in parentheses.  
    - Use abbreviations consistently throughout the text.
    - Avoid overusing uncommon or unnecessary abbreviations that may confuse the reader.
    - Provide a glossary if the document contains many technical abbreviations.
- **Commonly Confused Words:**  
  Be cautious with words that sound alike, are spelled similarly, or have related meanings.
- **Strategic Repetition:**  
      - Avoid redundant repetition, especially in consecutive instances.
      - Use repetition purposefully to emphasize or clarify key points.
      - Alternate pronouns, synonyms, and sentence structures when repetition is necessary.
- **Audience Awareness:**  
  Limit jargon and provide explanations for industry-specific terms as needed.

## **3. Lists and Series Structure**

Structure lists and series with clear, parallel elements:
- **Parallel Structure:**  
  Ensure parallelism in:  
      - Lists and series  
      - Coordinating conjunctions (e.g., *and, but, or*)  
      - Correlative conjunctions (e.g., *either...or, neither...nor*)  
      - Comparisons (e.g., *more than, as...as*)  
      - Infinitive phrases (e.g., *to increase, to improve*)  
      - Gerund phrases (e.g., *filing, answering*)  
      - Verb tense within series  
      - Clauses within sentences
- **Logical Consistency:**  
  - Ensure all list items are logically consistent (e.g., avoid mixing actions with descriptions).  
  - Group related items or use hierarchical lists for clarity.
- **Eliminate Redundancy:**  
  Remove words common to all list items.
- **Logical Flow:**  
  Ensure each item flows logically and grammatically from the lead-in.
- **Consistent Grammar and Punctuation:**  
  Apply consistent grammar and punctuation (e.g., periods, semicolons, or none) across all items.

## **4. Sentence Structure**

Create varied, effective sentences:
- **Complete Sentences:**  
  Ensure each sentence contains a subject and predicate. Avoid fragments.
- **Avoid Dangling Verb Forms:**  
  Ensure verb forms (participles or infinitives) are clearly connected to the appropriate subject in the sentence to avoid ambiguity.
- **Conciseness:**  
  Eliminate unnecessary words and redundancy.
- **Structural Variety:**  
  Use a mix of simple, compound, and complex sentences.
- **Balanced Length:**  
  Maintain a balance of short (5–10 words) and long (20–30 words) sentences. Avoid sequences of overly short or long sentences.
- **Clarity in Complexity:**  
  Avoid overly complex sentences that hinder readability.

## **5. Paragraph Structure**

Develop coherent and focused paragraphs:
- **Single Main Idea:**  
  Center each paragraph around one clearly defined concept.
- **Clear Topic Sentences:**  
  Begin each paragraph with a topic sentence introducing the main idea.
- **Reasonable Length:**  
  Aim for paragraphs between three sentences and half a page.
- **Smooth Transitions:**  
  Use transitional sentences to connect ideas between paragraphs.

---

## **6. Coherence and Flow**

Ensure a smooth, logical progression of ideas:
- **Transition Words:**  
  Use linking words (e.g., *however*, *therefore*, *in addition*) to guide readers through the text.
- **Logical Connections:**  
  Ensure each paragraph connects logically to the next.
- **Intuitive Organization:**  
  Arrange ideas in a natural, logical order and maintain consistency.

## **7. Clarity and Precision**

Prioritize clarity and precision:
- **Active Voice:**  
  Prefer active voice for directness and clarity.
- **Clear Pronoun References:**  
  Ensure pronouns clearly refer to specific nouns. Use *this/that/these/those* with appropriate nouns for clarity.
- **Specific Word Choice:**  
  Use precise nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs.
- **Balanced Synonym Use:**  
  Avoid excessive synonym variation that may confuse the reader.
- **Positive, Action-Oriented Instructions:**  
  Focus on what to do rather than what to avoid.  
      - Action-oriented instructions are typically more direct.  
      - Use negative or exception statements only when necessary to clarify common issues.
