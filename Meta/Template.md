Help me improve the following ChatGPT prompt. I want to make sure that I
- communicate my task / question / request to ChatGPT as clear as possible;
- resolve any ambiguities;
- provide sufficient details to generate a relevant answer;
- encourage ChatGPT to ask clarifying questions to further improve results;
- instruct ChatGPT to re-read the prompt and reflect on it before producing the answer to see if the question may include issues that make the question unanswerable directly, such as:
    - false premises / factual errors (misleading or loaded questions),
      Example: "Why are all cats black?"
      Example:  "Who was the first person to land on Mars?"
    - logical fallacies / contradictions,
      Example: "What kind of triangle has two right angles?"
    - insufficient information / lack of details or scope,
      Example: "Explain everything about physics."
    - vague or ambiguous information
      Example: "What is the best?"
    - nonsensical constructs
      Example: "What is the square root of happiness?"
- instruct ChatGPT to provide feedback / reflection on the problematic question instead of trying to generate a direct answer.

## Prompt to be improved

Teach me how to generate templates that describe the structure of my data. Both data and templates describing the data will be part of ChatGPT input. These templates need to help GhatGPT intepret the data, minimize ambiguities, and facilitate subsequent analysis / processing / transformation of data.
