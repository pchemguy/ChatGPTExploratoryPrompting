### **Step 2: Template Example**

#### Template Name: **Customer Profile Data**
**Purpose:** This template defines the structure for storing customer information to enable personalized recommendations.

---

#### **Field Definitions:**

| **Field**           | **Description**                           | **Data Type** | **Format**           | **Required** |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------|----------------------|--------------|
| `CustomerID`        | A unique identifier for the customer      | Integer       | N/A                  | Yes          |
| `FirstName`         | Customer's first name                     | Text          | N/A                  | Yes          |
| `LastName`          | Customer's last name                      | Text          | N/A                  | Yes          |
| `Email`             | Customer's email address                  | Text          | Valid email format   | Yes          |
| `DateOfBirth`       | Customer's date of birth                  | Date          | `YYYY-MM-DD`         | Optional     |
| `PurchaseHistory`   | List of past purchases by the customer     | Array         | See nested format    | Optional     |
| `VIPStatus`         | Whether the customer is a VIP             | Boolean       | `true` or `false`    | Optional     |

---

#### **Relationships and Hierarchies:**
- The `PurchaseHistory` field contains a nested structure:
    - Each entry includes:
      - `PurchaseID` (Integer): Unique ID for the purchase.
      - `Date` (Date): Date of purchase in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
      - `Amount` (Float): Total amount spent.

---

#### **Examples:**

**Input Example 1 (Complete Data):**
```json
{
  "CustomerID": 12345,
  "FirstName": "John",
  "LastName": "Doe",
  "Email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "DateOfBirth": "1985-06-15",
  "PurchaseHistory": [
    {
      "PurchaseID": 9876,
      "Date": "2023-07-12",
      "Amount": 129.99
    },
    {
      "PurchaseID": 9877,
      "Date": "2023-08-02",
      "Amount": 79.50
    }
  ],
  "VIPStatus": true
}
```

**Input Example 2 (Minimal Data):**
```json
{
  "CustomerID": 67890,
  "FirstName": "Jane",
  "LastName": "Smith",
  "Email": "jane.smith@example.com"
}
```

---

#### **Clarifications and Notes:**
- `CustomerID` must always be unique.
- Ensure emails are validated before input.
- If `DateOfBirth` is omitted, age-related recommendations will not be possible.
- For `PurchaseHistory`, omit the field entirely if there are no purchases.

---
