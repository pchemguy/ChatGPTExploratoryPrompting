### Cross-session continuity

# Memory Context

The original training data is the primary resource used by ChatGPT to answer the questions, but it is important to understand what other sources shape the answers.

1. Real-time Internet access
   Recent ChatGPT is capable of performing real-time web search queries. The retrieved information is then incorporated into the answer. Note that the free plan provides limited access to this feature. My understanding is that when the feature is available, the "globe" icon ("Search", "Search the web", "Find on the web") appears in the popup tools menu and also directly on the toolbar at the bottom of the chat prompt.
2. Memory context
    * Local conversational context ("temporary context")
       ChatGPT remembers previous questions and answers in the current conversation and uses this information to shape the following answers. When a new conversation is started via the "New Chat" button, the current conversation context should be empty.
    * Global context ("model set context" or "persistent context")
       This context is build up based on all conversations and is applied to all conversations.

### Q: Tell me about customizations applicable to this conversations that are based on my previous ChatGPT conversations.

### Q: If I understand it right, these customizations are saved across conversations as the global default context, and I can have it adjusted as necessary? Can I also request to discard the current context and work out a new context from scratch?

<details>
<summary><b>ChatGPT Answer</b></summary>

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, you're absolutely correct. Here’s a detailed breakdown:
  
1. **Global Default Context**
    - The customizations we've established are saved across conversations and act as a default context for how I respond.
    - They can be adjusted or refined at any time to better suit your evolving needs.
2. **Adjustments**
    - You can request changes to specific aspects of the context, such as adding new preferences, modifying existing ones, or temporarily suspending certain guidelines for a particular conversation.
3. **Reset and Redefine**
    - If you want, you can discard the current context entirely and start from scratch. This allows you to define a new set of preferences tailored to your immediate goals or interests.
4. **Temporary Overrides**
    - For any single conversation, you can specify different preferences without affecting the global context.  
</details>

### Q: Is there a specific technical term for what I referred to as "global context" understood by ChatGPT?

<details>
<summary><b>ChatGPT Answer</b></summary>

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the specific technical term for what you're referring to as "global context" is **"model set context"** or simply **"context memory"**. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Model Set Context**:
    
    - Refers to the saved information or preferences that persist across conversations with the same user.
    - Includes user-provided preferences, goals, and instructions that shape the way responses are tailored.
2. **Adjustable Context**:
    
    - It can be updated, refined, or reset entirely based on your preferences or changing needs.
3. **Temporary vs. Persistent Context**:
    
    - **Temporary Context**: Customizations or instructions applied for a single session or specific conversation.
    - **Persistent Context**: Saved information that carries over between conversations, forming a "default" set of guidelines.
</details>

### Q: So there is a part of context memory that is based on Q&A from the current conversation, and the part that is based on previous conversations. The former is conversation specific, and the latter applies to all conversations. Is this correct? If yes, can these two parts be separated and adjusted by the user?

<details>
<summary><b>ChatGPT Answer</b></summary>

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, you’re absolutely right. The **context memory** is essentially divided into two parts:

1. **Conversation-Specific Context** (Temporary Context):
    
    - This is based on the Q&A within the current conversation.
    - It is transient and does not carry over to future conversations.
    - Adjustments here are inherently limited to the ongoing session.
2. **Persistent Context** (Model Set Context):
    
    - This is based on customizations saved from previous conversations.
    - It persists across all future conversations unless modified or discarded.
    - This forms the "default" behavior for responses.

**Adjustability:**

- **Separation**:
    
    - These two parts are inherently separate in functionality.
    - The conversation-specific context influences only the current chat.
    - The persistent context influences behavior across all chats but can be temporarily overridden in a single session.
- **Adjustments**:
    
    1. **Conversation-Specific Adjustments**:
        - You can clarify or refine the context for a single session by giving specific instructions.
        - For example: "In this conversation, treat responses as if they were for a professional audience."
    2. **Persistent Adjustments**:
        - You can ask to update, refine, or discard persistent preferences at any time.
        - For example: "Remove my preference for Markdown formatting from the persistent context."

- After receiving an answer, ask for adjustments:
    - _“Make this more concise.”_
    - _“Add examples to support the argument.”_
- Encourage the model to expand or improve specific areas of interest.

##### 6. **Ask for Clarifications or Explanations**

- If the model provides insufficiently detailed answers, probe further:
    - _“Why did you choose this approach?”_
    - _“Can you expand on this point?”_

##### 7. **Correct Misinterpretations Immediately**

- If the model misunderstands your request, rephrase or clarify:
    - _“I meant X, not Y. Please adjust accordingly.”_

##### 8. **Segment Complex Tasks**

- Break down larger tasks into smaller, manageable components:
    - _“First, provide a detailed outline of this essay. Then, expand the introduction.”_

##### 9. **Use Consistent Terminology**

- Reuse terms and phrases introduced earlier in the session to reinforce your focus. This ensures the model stays aligned with your intent.

##### 10. **Review and Update Persistent Context**

- Periodically verify and update stored preferences, especially if your focus shifts (e.g., moving from academic essays to business communication).

##### 11. **Incorporate Post-Processing**

- After receiving an output, combine model-generated content with your insights for fine-tuned results:
    - _“I like this part; can you combine it with the earlier example you provided?”_

---

#### Practical Example: Maximizing Model Context

Imagine you want a detailed essay outline:

1. **Set the Scene**:
    
    - _“Draft an outline for an essay on the History of U.S. Foreign Policy in the Post-WWII Era. The essay should be five pages long, in an academic tone, with clear sections.”_
2. **Refine the Output**:
    
    - _“Expand the introduction to include background on the Cold War. Condense the conclusion to focus on modern implications.”_
3. **Iterate Further**:
    
    - _“Provide a bullet point for each key event mentioned under the ‘Post-Cold War Era’ section.”_
4. **Adjust Persistent Context**:
    
    - _“Add this preference to my memory: I like academic essays with clear subheadings and detailed timelines.”_

### Q: Can I train Custom GPTs?

<details>
<summary><b>ChatGPT Answer</b></summary>
You **cannot directly train Custom GPTs** in the traditional sense (e.g., fine-tuning with new data), but you can **customize their behavior and extend their knowledge** in several ways. OpenAI provides tools for configuring the model without requiring extensive machine learning expertise. Here's how:

---

#### Ways to Customize Custom GPTs:

#### 1. **Instruction Customization:**
   - You can define system-level instructions that guide how the GPT responds. For example:
     - Specify tone: friendly, professional, or technical.
     - Limit the scope: prioritize certain topics or ignore others.
     - Provide rules: enforce company policies or specific response formats.

##### 2. **Use Reference Files:**
   - Upload documents or files that your GPT can use as a **knowledge base** during interactions. These files provide context but are not part of the model's core training.
   - Example: Uploading a product catalog so the GPT can answer questions about your offerings.

##### 3. **API and Tool Integration:**
   - Custom GPTs can be connected to external tools and APIs. This extends their functionality, allowing them to fetch real-time data, interact with databases, or perform calculations.
   - Example: Integrating with a weather API to provide forecasts.

##### 4. **Memory:**
   - For accounts with memory-enabled models, GPTs can retain specific information about users or ongoing projects across sessions. This enables more personalized and context-aware responses.

##### 5. **Role-Playing and Pre-Defined Scenarios:**
   - You can set up a Custom GPT with specific personas or scenarios by defining a detailed set of instructions and sample interactions.

---

#### Why Can't You Fine-Tune Custom GPTs?
OpenAI has chosen to focus on **instruction-based customization** rather than direct fine-tuning for Custom GPTs, to ensure:
   - **Security:** Preventing misuse or the accidental introduction of harmful biases.
   - **Ease of Use:** Allowing non-technical users to create Custom GPTs without needing machine learning expertise.
   - **Scalability:** Reducing the complexity of managing and deploying numerous fine-tuned models.

---

#### Fine-Tuning as an Alternative
For users needing true model training (e.g., integrating a proprietary dataset deeply into the model), OpenAI offers **fine-tuning** capabilities separately, but this is distinct from the Custom GPT framework. Fine-tuning:
   - Involves training the base GPT model with additional data.
   - Requires technical expertise and access to OpenAI's fine-tuning API.
   - Is better for niche tasks or domains requiring specialized knowledge.

### Q: I want to learn more about fine-tuning GPTs. How can I do it? Do I have appropriate access?

<details>
<summary><b>ChatGPT Answer</b></summary>
To fine-tune GPTs, you’ll need access to OpenAI’s fine-tuning tools, which are designed for creating models tailored to specific tasks or datasets. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you understand the process and verify your access:

---

#### **What is Fine-Tuning?**
Fine-tuning is the process of training a pre-existing GPT model (like GPT-3.5 or GPT-4) on your own dataset to specialize it for a specific use case. This process adjusts the model’s weights slightly, allowing it to generate responses more aligned with your dataset or goals.

---

#### **Prerequisites for Fine-Tuning**
1. **Access to OpenAI's Fine-Tuning API:**
   - Fine-tuning may require specific permissions in your OpenAI account. Ensure you have access to this feature.
   - If unsure, you can check your OpenAI account dashboard or reach out to OpenAI support.

2. **Dataset Preparation:**
   - You need a dataset in JSONL format, where each line represents a training example.
   - Format: `{"prompt": "input text", "completion": "output text"}`.
   - Ensure the dataset is clean, diverse, and relevant to your use case.

3. **OpenAI API Key:**
   - Ensure you have an API key with sufficient quota and permissions.

4. **Budget:**
   - Fine-tuning costs vary depending on the model (e.g., GPT-3.5 is cheaper than GPT-4).
   - Costs include training and usage of the fine-tuned model.

---

#### **Steps to Fine-Tune GPTs**
1. **Prepare Your Dataset:**
   - Collect data that reflects your use case (e.g., customer queries, domain-specific Q&A, creative prompts).
   - Split the data into training and validation sets.

2. **Validate Your Dataset:**
   - Use OpenAI's data preparation tools to check your dataset for errors and formatting issues:
     ```bash
     openai tools fine_tunes.prepare_data -f "your_file.jsonl"
     ```

3. **Upload Your Dataset:**
   - Upload your dataset to OpenAI using the API:
     ```bash
     openai api files.upload -f "your_file.jsonl"
     ```

4. **Create a Fine-Tune Job:**
   - Start the fine-tuning process:
     ```bash
     openai api fine_tunes.create -t "file-id" -m "model-name"
     ```
     - Replace `"file-id"` with the file ID from your upload.
     - Replace `"model-name"` with the base model (e.g., `curie`, `davinci`, `gpt-3.5-turbo`).

5. **Monitor the Fine-Tuning Job:**
   - Track progress using:
     ```bash
     openai api fine_tunes.follow -i "fine-tune-id"
     ```

6. **Use Your Fine-Tuned Model:**
   - Once completed, your fine-tuned model will have a unique ID. Use this ID to make API calls:
     ```bash
     openai api completions.create -m "fine-tuned-model-id" -p "Your prompt"
     ```

---

#### **How to Check If You Have Fine-Tuning Access**
1. **Log into OpenAI:**
   - Visit your OpenAI dashboard and navigate to the API section.
   - Look for fine-tuning-related options or documentation links.

2. **Contact OpenAI Support:**
   - If you’re unsure about your access, reach out to OpenAI support for confirmation.

3. **API Key Validation:**
   - Test the fine-tuning commands mentioned above with your API key. If you lack permissions, the API will return an error indicating restricted access.

---

#### **Best Practices for Fine-Tuning**
- **Use High-Quality Data:** Garbage in, garbage out—ensure your dataset is well-curated.
- **Start Small:** Experiment with smaller datasets and simpler models (like `curie`) before scaling up.
- **Evaluate Regularly:** Validate the fine-tuned model’s performance against real-world examples to ensure it meets your expectations.
- **Monitor Costs:** Keep an eye on training and usage costs to avoid unexpected expenses.

# Writing Context and Guidelines

## Efficient Technical and Business Writing - Writing Style Guidelines for Technical and Business Texts

 ChatGPT is a powerful writing assistant capable of improving various text aspects for more efficient communications. Although ChatGPT
 performs reasonably well with basic prompts (such as "Convert the following text into standard English"), I wanted to create a comprehensive list of instructions that I can use either in its entirety or selectively, depending on the task. To this end, I have developed two documents:

* Stylistic Guidelines ([Writing Style Guidelines for Technical and Business Texts][WritingStyleGuidelines])  
  These guidelines are designed to be sent directly to ChatGPT and focus on writing mechanics, structure, vocabulary, sentence construction, and coherence. These aspects should apply to most of my writing activities.
* Context Template ([Writing Context Guidelines][WritingContext])  
  This template offers customizable options for defining higher-level writing aspects, such as audience, domain, intent, formality, tone, and other contextual factors. It also allows for tailored "profile" contexts (e.g., "LinkedIn Post") that can be included when submitting the entire contents to ChatGPT, instructing it to apply a specific profile.
