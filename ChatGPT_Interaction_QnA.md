# Improving ChatGPT Interaction - Q&A

I am exploring ways to interact with ChatGPT more thoughtfully and effectively and wanted to share my collection of select questions/prompts and answers. The goal is to help surface possibly overlooked considerations, rather than provide definitive answers or recipes, shifting some of the "unknown unknowns" of ChatGPT workflows into the realm of "known unknowns". I should warn, however, that I have not critically evaluated the provided answers, as I am still learning and do not claim expertise in these areas. Some of the questions/prompts shared here were constructed based on information gathered from other ChatGPT interactions. My aim is simply to share what I have explored in the hope it might spark ideas or be of use to others on a similar path.



This collection of questions/prompts, and select associated answers focus on technical topics related to efficient interaction with ChatGPT. 
The goal is to help surface possibly overlooked considerations, rather than provide definitive answers or recipes, shifting some of the "unknown unknowns" of ChatGPT workflows into the realm of "known unknowns". Think of it as a companion for exploring ways to interact with this tool more thoughtfully and effectively.


Note, however, that I have not attempted to critically evaluate provided answers. In fact, as a beginner, I do not have such an expertise. Also, some of the questions/prompts have been constructed using information from other ChatGPT responses.

The below questions/prompts and associated answers (where deemed useful) focus on technical topics related to efficient interaction with ChatGPT. Their mere purpose is to serve as a starting point for bringing the unknown unknowns aspects of ChatGPT workflows into the realm of known unknowns.
