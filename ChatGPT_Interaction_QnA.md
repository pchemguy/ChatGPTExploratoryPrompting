# Improving ChatGPT Interaction - Q&A

I am exploring ways to interact with ChatGPT more thoughtfully and effectively and wanted to share a selection of questions/prompts and answers. The goal is to surface overlooked considerations rather than provide definitive answers or solutions, shifting some 'unknown unknowns' of ChatGPT workflows into 'known unknowns.' Since I am still learning, I have not critically evaluated the answers shared here. Additionally, some of the questions/prompts were constructed based on insights from other ChatGPT interactions. My hope is that this collection inspires ideas and proves helpful to others on a similar path.
