### Q: What is the best way to indicate that a particular input constitutes a set of instructions, such as context specification?

<details>
<summary><b>ChatGPT Answer</b></summary>

&nbsp;The best way to indicate that an input constitutes a **set of instructions**—especially for context specification in ChatGPT—is to structure it clearly and explicitly. Here are some effective strategies:

---

#### **1. Use Delimiters to Isolate Instructions**
Delimiters like quotes, triple backticks, or brackets clearly separate instructions from other input.  
**Example:**
```
Instructions:  
"You are a travel guide. Provide recommendations for a week-long trip to Japan."
```

**Or**  
```
#### Instructions ###
You are a financial analyst. Provide insights on investment strategies for beginners.
```

---

#### **2. Provide Explicit Labels**
Label sections clearly, such as **Context**, **Instructions**, or **Task**. This ensures the model understands the function of each part.  
**Example:**
```
Context: You are a friendly customer service chatbot.  
Task: Answer the following question in a helpful and polite tone.
```

---

#### **3. Use System Messages (For API or Chat)**
In platforms like ChatGPT, **system messages** define context clearly. Although not visible to all users in the UI, they are essential in API interactions.  
**Example (if coding):**
```json
{
  "role": "system",
  "content": "You are a helpful tutor specializing in math."
}
```

In the UI:
```
System Message: You are a financial assistant providing personal finance advice.
```

---

#### **4. Number or Bullet Instructions**  
This helps in multi-step tasks where instructions need to be followed sequentially.  
**Example:**
```
Follow these instructions:
1. Provide a list of healthy recipes.
2. Explain the nutritional benefits of each recipe.
3. Suggest variations for vegetarian diets.
```

---

#### **5. State the Instruction Role Explicitly**

## Memory Context

### Q: Tell me about customizations applicable to this conversations that are based on my previous ChatGPT conversations.

### Q: If I understand it right, these customizations are saved across conversations as the global default context, and I can have it adjusted as necessary? Can I also request to discard the current context and work out a new context from scratch?

<details>
<summary><b>ChatGPT Answer</b></summary>

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, you're absolutely correct. Here’s a detailed breakdown:
  
1. **Global Default Context**
    - The customizations we've established are saved across conversations and act as a default context for how I respond.
    - They can be adjusted or refined at any time to better suit your evolving needs.
2. **Adjustments**
    - You can request changes to specific aspects of the context, such as adding new preferences, modifying existing ones, or temporarily suspending certain guidelines for a particular conversation.
3. **Reset and Redefine**
    - If you want, you can discard the current context entirely and start from scratch. This allows you to define a new set of preferences tailored to your immediate goals or interests.
4. **Temporary Overrides**
    - For any single conversation, you can specify different preferences without affecting the global context.  
</details>
 
* "Local" conversational context ("temporary context")
  ChatGPT remembers previous questions and answers in the current conversation and uses this information to shape the following answers. When a new conversation is started via the "New Chat" button, the current conversation context should be empty.
* "Global" context ("model set context" or "persistent context")
  This context is built up based on all conversations and is applied to all conversations.

### Q: Is there a specific technical term for what I referred to as "global context" understood by ChatGPT?

<details>
<summary><b>ChatGPT Answer</b></summary>

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the specific technical term for what you're referring to as "global context" is **"model set context"** or simply **"context memory"**. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Model Set Context**:
    
    - Refers to the saved information or preferences that persist across conversations with the same user.
    - Includes user-provided preferences, goals, and instructions that shape the way responses are tailored.
2. **Adjustable Context**:
    
    - It can be updated, refined, or reset entirely based on your preferences or changing needs.
3. **Temporary vs. Persistent Context**:
    
    - **Temporary Context**: Customizations or instructions applied for a single session or specific conversation.
    - **Persistent Context**: Saved information that carries over between conversations, forming a "default" set of guidelines.
</details>

### Q: So there is a part of context memory that is based on Q&A from the current conversation, and the part that is based on previous conversations. The former is conversation specific, and the latter applies to all conversations. Is this correct? If yes, can these two parts be separated and adjusted by the user?

<details>
<summary><b>ChatGPT Answer</b></summary>

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, you’re absolutely right. The **context memory** is essentially divided into two parts:

1. **Conversation-Specific Context** (Temporary Context):
    
    - This is based on the Q&A within the current conversation.
    - It is transient and does not carry over to future conversations.
    - Adjustments here are inherently limited to the ongoing session.
2. **Persistent Context** (Model Set Context):
    
    - This is based on customizations saved from previous conversations.
    - It persists across all future conversations unless modified or discarded.
    - This forms the "default" behavior for responses.

**Adjustability:**

- **Separation**:
    
    - These two parts are inherently separate in functionality.

&nbsp;  
#### Understanding ChatGPT Model Context

**Model context** refers to the information the ChatGPT model uses to generate relevant and accurate responses. It includes the following:

1. **Conversation History**: The sequence of previous inputs and responses in the current session. The model leverages this history to maintain continuity and relevance.
    
2. **Explicit User Instructions**: Any preferences or guidelines explicitly provided by the user, such as formatting styles, tone, or depth of detail.
    
3. **Persistent Context (Model Memory)**: Stored information about you or your preferences that persists across sessions, provided you’ve allowed it. For example, your interest in improving prompt engineering or specific essay topics.
    
4. **Implicit Context Cues**: Information inferred from your phrasing, choice of words, or focus areas within a single interaction.

    - _“Please draft a concise LinkedIn post summarizing this content.”_
- Tailor the model's output by specifying audience type, format, tone, or depth of explanation.

##### 2. **Leverage Persistent Context**

- If the model supports persistent memory, share long-term preferences early on (e.g., preferred writing style, academic focus areas). This eliminates repetitive instructions and refines outputs over time.

##### 3. **Control Depth and Detail**

- Indicate desired detail levels using qualifiers:
    - _“Explain in layman’s terms.”_
    - _“Provide a technical analysis suitable for an advanced reader.”_
    - _“Summarize in three bullet points.”_
- This helps the model tailor its response without guesswork.

##### 4. **Guide with Examples and Templates**

- Provide examples of desired outputs, e.g.:
    - _“Structure your response like this: [example structure].”_
- Use templates for recurring tasks (e.g., a LinkedIn post or essay outline).

##### 5. **Iterative Refinement**

- After receiving an answer, ask for adjustments:
    - _“Make this more concise.”_
    - _“Add examples to support the argument.”_
- Encourage the model to expand or improve specific areas of interest.

##### 6. **Ask for Clarifications or Explanations**

- If the model provides insufficiently detailed answers, probe further:
    - _“Why did you choose this approach?”_
    - _“Can you expand on this point?”_

##### 7. **Correct Misinterpretations Immediately**

- If the model misunderstands your request, rephrase or clarify:
    - _“I meant X, not Y. Please adjust accordingly.”_

##### 8. **Segment Complex Tasks**

- Break down larger tasks into smaller, manageable components:
    - _“First, provide a detailed outline of this essay. Then, expand the introduction.”_

##### 9. **Use Consistent Terminology**

- Reuse terms and phrases introduced earlier in the session to reinforce your focus. This ensures the model stays aligned with your intent.

##### 10. **Review and Update Persistent Context**

- Periodically verify and update stored preferences, especially if your focus shifts (e.g., moving from academic essays to business communication).

##### 11. **Incorporate Post-Processing**

- After receiving an output, combine model-generated content with your insights for fine-tuned results:
    - _“I like this part; can you combine it with the earlier example you provided?”_

---

#### Practical Example: Maximizing Model Context

Imagine you want a detailed essay outline:

1. **Set the Scene**:
    
    - _“Draft an outline for an essay on the History of U.S. Foreign Policy in the Post-WWII Era. The essay should be five pages long, in an academic tone, with clear sections.”_
2. **Refine the Output**:
    
    - _“Expand the introduction to include background on the Cold War. Condense the conclusion to focus on modern implications.”_
3. **Iterate Further**:
    
    - _“Provide a bullet point for each key event mentioned under the ‘Post-Cold War Era’ section.”_
4. **Adjust Persistent Context**:
    
    - _“Add this preference to my memory: I like academic essays with clear subheadings and detailed timelines.”_
